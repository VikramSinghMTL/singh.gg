# Vik's Digital Garden ðŸŒ±

Welcome to the repository for my Digital Garden, an ever-growing collection of interconnected notes, ideas, and resources on topics I care about, such as computer science, education, research, and more.

## What is a Digital Garden?

A digital garden is a curated, evolving collection of knowledge where notes are interlinked and continuously updated. Itâ€™s not just a blog or a static siteâ€”itâ€™s a space for learning, exploring, and sharing ideas in their various stages of growth.

## Explore the Garden

You can browse the live digital garden at [https://singh.gg](https://singh.gg).

Here youâ€™ll find:

-   Notes on pedagogy and computer science.=

-   Summaries and reflections on key readings.

-   Tools and resources for educators.

-   Ideas in progressâ€”because learning is never finished.

## Technical Details

This digital garden is built using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) as the primary note-taking tool and published online using the [Obsidian Digital Garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden) plugin. The site is generated with 11ty (Eleventy) for a fast, static web experience.
