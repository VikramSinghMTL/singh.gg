  abstract = {Gamification is the use of game elements in domains other than games. Gamification use is often suggested for difficult activities because it enhances users' engagement and motivation level. Due to such benefits, the use of gamification is also proposed in education environments to improve students' performance, engagement, and satisfaction. Computer science in higher education is a tough area of study and thus needs to utilize various already explored benefits of gamification. This research develops an empirical study to evaluate the effectiveness of gamification in teaching computer science in higher education. Along with the learning outcomes, the effect of group size on students' satisfaction level is also measured. Furthermore, the impact of gamification over time is analyzed throughout a semester to observe its effectiveness as a long-term learning technique. The analysis, covering both learning outcome and students' satisfaction, suggests that gamification is an effective tool to teach tough courses at higher education level; however, group size should be taken into account for optimal classroom size and better learning experience.},

In this paper, we will explain different theoretical support for the benefit of using game in education and learning. We will also demonstrate the difference among those methods such as, Game Base Learning(GBL), educational game and Gamification in education. A clear description among these new terms with explanation of the possible impact on teaching and learning will be presented. Games can make learning concept more enjoyable for students and provide a platform for their creative thought. Games will often act as learning triggers inducing lively discussion on learning concepts amongst students following game play. A couple of new ways of teaching like Game Based Learning and Gamification can be applied to enhance the learning procedure of students in various age levels.},

While some systems provide automated feedback, human feedback is more effective for novice learners. However, instructors cannot provide feedback quickly at a large scale. Peer feedback systems help students get prompt feedback during class. Existing CS peer feedback systems usually support feedback on completed code rather than work in progress, which limits opportunities to reflect on the feedback and correct their work. We introduce a novel system for giving peer feedback on code in progress during CS1 classes, as well as a pilot test of the peer feedback process in CS1. Our initial experience has implications for the delivery of in-class instruction and for teaching growth mindset in order to take full advantage of peer feedback.},

The Internet is a vast ocean of information sources, albeit with diverse reliability and quality. In Web 2.0 platforms, any participant can be a content creator. This reality is challenging for both the instructors and the students. We conducted interviews with 12 Computer Science students and 8 instructors from two universities to (a) identify the difficulties students encounter, if at all, (b) identify the learning processes that students undergo, if at all, when using the Internet for their CS studies, in particular, programming tasks; and (c) elicit instructors' perceptions of students' use of the Internet. Both students and instructors agreed that although using the Internet is not trivial, direct teaching of this skill is unnecessary. Instructors differed in their attitudes towards students' use of the internet. We found that in the first year the students' use of the Internet and their difficulties are similar to reports in the empirical literature, and echo the instructors' concerns. However, after extensive experience, students undergo a learning process, and their ability to navigate the myriad sources, as well as to search, manage, and effectively evaluate Internet sources improves. Students mentioned their improved abilities to code as a means to effectively evaluate information sources.},

One problem is determining the relative roles of talent vs. deliberate practice in the acquisition of expertise. When studying teachers, however, a third factor must be considered, that of context. The working conditions of teachers exert a powerful influence on the development of expertise. A second problem is that of definition because expertise in teaching takes different forms in different cultures, and its characteristics change by decade. A distinction is drawn between the good teacher and the successful teacher, characteristics of expertise that are often confused. A prototypical model of expertise is described and found to identify teachers who were both good and successful. Discussed also is the importance of understanding adaptive or fluid expertise, automaticity and flexibility. Finally, the development of teacher expertise is seen as an increase in agency over time. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

"Constructive alignment" represents a marriage of the two thrusts, constructivism being used as a framework to guide decision-making at all stages in instructional design: in derivingcurriculumobjectivesin terms of performancesthat represent a suitably high cognitive level, in deciding teaching/learningactivitiesjudged to elicit those performances, and to assess and summativelyreport studentperformance.The "performances of understanding" nominated in the objectivesare thus used to systematicallyalign the teaching methods and the assessment.

Students are willing to take on hard, frustrating, and even time-consuming challenges within video games for intangible rewards and feelings of accomplishment. Therefore, our goal is to gamify Computer Science learning to achieve the same levels of engagement and fulfillment as video games do. To do so, we have begun development of a serious game that introduces CS concepts in a fun and interactive way. To measure the level of interest and engagement brought on by this game, we let volunteers from CS as well as in other majors play our prototype. After playing the games, each volunteer filled out a survey comparing their enjoyment in learning through games as opposed to traditional classroom learning. With this feedback we concluded that gamification is key in changing the learning experience for CS students and will help them achieve their learning goals.},

  abstract = {Gamified'' active learning has been shown to increase students' academic performance and engagement and help them make more social connections than standard course settings. However, the costs to use an educational game design with efficient delivery of the game/course plan can be problematic. Our first objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of gamification by using existing techniques (e.g., simple HTML-based games) and readily available collaborative tools (e.g., wikis) from a typical learning management system (LMS), such as Blackboard. Our second objective was to examine students' attitudes toward gamification (e.g., perceived usefulness). An online survey was given to 80 graduate students who took an entry-level biostatistics course from 2015 to 2017 at a midwestern university in the United States. Our study was conducted using an experimental group (class with implementation of gamification) and control group (class without implementation of gamified activities) that were randomly selected from graduate-level statistics courses. A Welch's independent t-test revealed a significant difference (p {$<$} .001) in the mean exam scores of the experimental and control groups. The difference favored classes with gamification. The findings suggest that using built-in LMS tools to design gamified learning activities can enhance students' academic performance and the competencies gained, as well as provide more diversified learning methods and motivation, and offer easy modifications for different learning needs.},

The challenges are described with recommendations on how to address each one.

To revisit the concept of team-teaching in the context of contemporary higher education, we proposed a new taxonomy of team teaching, using ``true team teaching'' (e.g. when each of the instructors is equally invested in the design, implementation, and assessment of the course), as the pinnacle. To evaluate the efficacy of our taxonomy, we conducted a study in which all full-time faculty members at a doctoral granting university were surveyed regarding their team-teaching experience and the applicability of the model to their work. When the results of that study demonstrated that a simple taxonomy is not sufficient to encompass the range of factors that significantly influence the success of team-teaching at the institutional level; we switched our orientation and used our results to develop new questions about both practice and research in team teaching.},

PI lectures present students with a series of multiple-choice questions, which they respond to both individually and in groups. PI has been widely successful in the physical sciences and, recently, has been successfully adopted by computer science instructors in lower-division, introductory courses. In this work, we challenge readers to consider PI for their upper-division courses as well. We present a PI curriculum for two upper-division computer science courses: Computer Architecture and Theory of Computation. These courses exemplify several perceived challenges to the adoption of PI in upper-division courses, including: exploration of abstract ideas, development of high-level judgment of engineering design trade-offs, and exercising advanced mathematical sophistication. This work includes selected course materials illustrating how these challenges are overcome, learning gains results comparing these upper-division courses with previous lower-division results in the literature, student attitudinal survey results (N = 501), and pragmatic advice to prospective developers and adopters. We present three main findings. First, we find that these upper-division courses achieved student learning gains equivalent to those reported in successful lower-division computing courses. Second, we find that student feedback for each class was overwhelmingly positive, with 88p of students recommending PI for use in other computer science classes. Third, we find that instructors adopting the materials introduced here were able to replicate the outcomes of the instructors who developed the materials in terms of student learning gains and student feedback.},

This article presents a review of past and current research on the relation of education to creativity in students of preschool age through age 16 in U.S. public schools. Several models of creative thinking are presented (e.g., Guilford, 1985; Renzulli, 1992; Runco \& Chand, 1995), as well as techniques for developing creativity (e.g., Davis, 1982; Sternberg \& Williams, 1996). Some research presented indicates a relation between creativity and learning (e.g., Karnes et al., 1961; Torrance, 1981). Implications for research and practice also are discussed.},

  abstract = {Education at universities requires a high proportion of self-study supported by instruments which motivate students to deepen their knowledge with case studies and training software. The gain in learning is higher when what is learned is reflected by others in a cooperative process. The Class Peer Review (CPR) requires from students to evaluate each other but lecturers lose a lot of time when applying it during the lecture. Research on CPR shows many different approaches to how this method should be carried out effectively and many of them still demand a high presence of the lecturer. In contrast to most studies, this article reports the results of a CPR conducted outside the classroom and assisted by a web-supported role playing game representing a publisher where a common online class journal is used as an incentive and motivational element. The effectiveness of CPR was examined by means of a quasi-experimental study. It turned out that the experimental group used the training software significantly more frequently in addition to the lecture materials and a meaningful increase in group dynamics was recorded. Also female students were more motivated to continue this type of group work in the future. Final grades were better under CPR conditions, but the effect was statistically weak. Basically, the CPR method seems to be an effective tool to extend problem-based teaching to the self-learning phase if practiced in combinaktion with a role play and fictive ClassJournals as incentive. This provides further potential to e-learning instruments.},

The decrease in attendance and difficulties in stimulating students' activity makes it necessary to find new methodologies that can solve these problems. The use of game mechanics in non-ludic environments (Gamification) has begun to be of great interest in research, since it could increase the motivation and therefore the activity of the students. This study tries to verify if there is an existing relationship between gamification and a possible increase in student activity or between the cessation of gamification and student activity. In addition, it evaluates whether a greater student activity corresponds to a greater learning improvement. In the obtained results, no significant differences were found between the methodology or the activity with a learning improvement. According to the study, the simple use of gamified elements does not necessarily imply a solution to the problems posed. The students' activity in a course of these characteristics does not imply a better learning improvement, the importance lies in the quality of the activity generated and not in the quantity.},

Finally, administrative and leadership issues are addressed and the outline of an action plan to implement blended learning approaches is presented. The conclusion is that blended learning is consistent with the values of traditional higher education institutions and has the proven potential to enhance both the effectiveness and efficiency of meaningful learning experiences.},

Teachers constantly try to find ways to strengthen the students' cognitive, emotional and behavioral engagement but often encounter administrative, pedagogical and technical challenges. Recently, in their effort to engage students in the learning process, higher education teachers are experimenting with the concept of gamification and the use of game elements into courses and classrooms. Nevertheless, gamification most of the times requires a system or platform in order to be successful. This paper provides a thorough review of current gamification platforms that can be utilized in a higher education setting and discusses challenges and opportunities experienced by both teachers and students while using them. Five popular gamification platforms are critically evaluated in order to assist teachers in choosing the right platform for their needs. For each platform, we present the supported gamification elements in terms of Dynamics, Mechanics and Components and we evaluate the type of gamification offered (reward-based or meaningful). Finally, we provide easy-to-interpret comparison tables with the characteristics of each platform.},

This evidence shows that although feedback is among the major influences, the type of feedback and the way it is given can be differentially effective. A model of feedback is then proposed that identifies the particular properties and circumstances that make it effective, and some typically thorny issues are discussed, including the timing of feedback and the effects of positive and negative feedback. Finally, this analysis is used to suggest ways in which feedback can be used to enhance its effectiveness in classrooms.},

  abstract = {Given the increasing importance of soft skills in the computing profession, there is good reason to provide students with more opportunities to learn and practice those skills in undergraduate computing courses. Toward that end, we have developed an active learning approach for computing education called the               Pedagogical Code Review               (PCR). Inspired by the               code inspection               process used in the software industry, a PCR is a collaborative activity in which a small team of students, led by a trained moderator: (a) walk through segments of each other's programming solutions, (b) check the code against a list of best coding practices, and (c) discuss and log issues that arise. To evaluate the viability and effectiveness of this approach, we conducted a series of four mixed-method empirical studies of various implementations of PCRs in CS1 courses at Washington State University. The first study validated the viability of the PCR activity. Using a quasi-experimental design, the final three studies evaluated two alternative implementations of PCRs---               face-to-face               and               online               . Our results provide evidence that PCRs can promote positive attitudinal shifts, and hone skills in critical review, teamwork, and communication. Based on our findings, we present a set of best practices for implementing PCRs.},

The data collected and analysed included logs, questionnaires, and pre- and post-tests. The results of the evaluation show positive effects on the engagement of students toward the gamified learning activities and a moderate improvement in learning outcomes. Students reported different motivations for continuing and stopping activities once they completed the mandatory assignment. The preferences for different gamified activities were also conditioned by academic milestones.},

  abstract = {Peer review is the standard process within academia for maintaining publication quality, but it is also widely employed in other settings, such as education and industry, for improving work quality and for generating actionable feedback to content authors. For example, in the software industry peer review of program source code---or peer code review---is a key technique for detecting bugs and maintaining coding standards. In a programming education context, although peer code review offers potential benefits to both code reviewers and code authors, individuals are typically less experienced, which presents a number of challenges. Some of these challenges are similar to those reported in the educational literature on peer review in other academic disciplines, but reviewing code presents unique difficulties. Better understanding these challenges and the conditions under which code review can be taught and implemented successfully in computer science courses is of value to the computing education community. In this work, we conduct a systematic review of the literature on peer code review in higher education to examine instructor motivations for conducting peer code review activities, how such activities have been implemented in practice, and the primary benefits and difficulties that have been reported. We initially identified 187 potential studies and analyzed 51 empirical studies pertinent to our goals. We report the most commonly cited benefits (e.g., the development of programming-related skills) and barriers (e.g., low student engagement), and we identify a wide variety of tools that have been used to facilitate the peer code review process. While we argue that more empirical work is needed to validate currently reported results related to learning outcomes, there is also a clear need to address the challenges around student motivation, which we believe could be an important avenue for future research.},

The goal of this work is to understand how gamification has been used to engage students in peer review activities and to summarize the empirical evidence for its effectiveness. Our main contribution is the presentation of a general model of the peer review process that captures the students' activities and an examination of the specific actions within this model that have been gamified in the current literature. We also summarize the commonly used game mechanics and the context and year level of courses in which prior research has been conducted, along with the reported effects on student behavior. We find that artifact assessment and artifact creation are the two most commonly gamified actions with respect to our peer review model and that the quantity and quality of both the artifacts and the generated feedback are the most popular reward criteria. In addition, Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) are the discipline areas in which gamified peer review activities are most often reported. In general, while the existing peer review literature reports mostly positive effects of gamification on student engagement, the range of student actions which have been incentivized remains narrow. Key activities, such as student reflection on the feedback received, have been largely unexplored with respect to gamification and thus present useful avenues for future work.},

However, a lack of motivation has been identified as one of the barriers to successful peer code review in programming courses. Low motivation may result in students avoiding or delaying their peer review tasks, reducing the potential benefits. In this study, gamification is used to overcome this barrier. We focus on motivating two behaviors: increasing the number of reviews submitted by students, and encouraging students to submit those reviews early. We conduct a randomized controlled study (N = 178) that compares the behavior of a control group engaged in peer code review using an online tool, with a gamification group that uses a modified version of the tool that includes targeted game elements. The results show a statistically significant difference in the number of submitted reviews between the control and gamification groups. Furthermore, the majority of students in the gamification group report that the game elements motivate them. Based on our findings, the game elements and game mechanics seem to be a promising method to motivate students in online peer code review activities.},

  abstract = {The practice of peer code review has been shown to deliver a variety of benefits to programming students. These include learning from producing and receiving feedback, and from being exposed to a range of problem-solving approaches and solutions. However, the success of a peer code review activity depends on the quality and accuracy of the reviews that students produce, and prior work has shown that these can sometimes be poor. One approach for addressing this problem is to incorporate motivational incentives directly into the design of the code review platform. In this research, we explore the use of gamification in an online peer code review tool, where game-like elements are used to reward students for generating accurate and helpful reviews. We report the results of a randomized controlled study (n=171) that measures both review accuracy and the perceived value of the feedback produced. Although quantitative ratings of the review quality did not differ significantly between control and experimental conditions, we observed interesting trends relating to the perceived value of the feedback. Students in both groups had similar views regarding the usefulness of the feedback they received on their own work, however students in the experimental condition tended to express more positive sentiments towards the quality of the feedback they produced for their peers and observed from other reviewers.},

We describe our experience with gamification, which we loosely define as a teaching technique that uses social gaming elements to deliver higher education. Over the past three years, we have applied gamification to undergraduate and graduate courses in a leading technical university in the Netherlands and in Europe. Ours is one of the first long-running attempts to show that gamification can be used to teach technically challenging courses. The two gamification-based courses, the first-year B.Sc. course Computer Organization and an M.Sc.-level course on the emerging technology of Cloud Computing, have been cumulatively followed by over 450 students and passed by over 75\% of them, at the first attempt. We find that gamification is correlated with an increase in the percentage of passing students, and in the participation in voluntary activities and challenging assignments. Gamification seems to also foster interaction in the classroom and trigger students to pay more attention to the design of the course. We also observe very positive student assessments and volunteered testimonials, and a Teacher of the Year award.},

To quantify the learning effect from the group component of these two-stage exams in an introductory Physics course, a randomized crossover design was used where each student participated in both the treatment and control groups. For each of the two two-stage collaborative group midterm exams, questions were designed to form matched near-transfer pairs with questions on an end-of-term diagnostic which was used as a learning test. For diagnostic test questions paired with questions from the first midterm, which took place six to seven weeks before the diagnostic test, an analysis using a mixed-effects logistic regression found no significant differences in diagnostic-test performance between the control and treatment group. For diagnostic test questions paired with questions from the second midterm, which took place one to two weeks prior to the diagnostic test, the treatment group performed significantly higher on the diagnostic-test than control.},

However, it is critical to provide students with assessment training before engaging them in peer assessment, as students may not be capable of understanding marking criteria and critically assessing their peers. The present study examined the effects of gamed-based assessment training on students' assessment skills and intrinsic motivation. A sample of 48 students participated in two peer assessment training modules; one control group was given the traditional, calibrated training and the treatment group received the game-based training. Data analysis indicated no significant difference in students' assessment skills between the two groups. Nevertheless, students in the gamebased group showed a significantly higher level of intrinsic motivation than students in the calibrated training group. Qualitative analysis of students' reflection essays confirmed the quantitative findings that game-based training may have improved students' intrinsic motivation. Implications and limitations are discussed.},

Much less attention is given to the processes of creating interdisciplinary education initiatives within traditional monodisciplinary universities. In this study, we thus explore how interdisciplinary education and teaching emerge and develop within universities that have little or no established infrastructure to support interdisciplinarity. Using qualitative data from a multi-part case study, we examine the development of diverse interdisciplinary educational efforts within a traditional faculty-structured university in order to map the ways in which interdisciplinary educational elements have been created, supported, challenged or even strengthened by preexisting monodisciplinary structures. Drawing on theories from economics, literature studies and sociology of education, we conclude that creating interdisciplinary education in such settings demands skills that we define as the `art of managing interstitiality'.},

In this paper, our approach gamifying the learning process of a subject is presented. Our experience throughout time in using games and gamification in learning have led us to propose, lately, a personalized, automated, and gamified learning system. As a result of this experience and after several years of continuous feedback from our students, we have learned several lessons on how to approach the task of gamification. These lessons are summarized in the following concepts: fun, motivation, autonomy, progressiveness, feedback, error tolerance, experimentation, creativity, and adaptation to the specific case. The final aim is sharing our experience and opening a debate about what key elements the gamification lie in.},

With the recent emphasis on curricula reform, there is a great focus on assessment and pedagogical practices to support student learning. To illustrate the tensions arising from these efforts, we present four pedagogical and assessment innovation approaches using both Shulman's (2005) Signature Pedagogies and Tatar's (2007) Design Tensions frameworks. The four approaches include problem-based learning, game-based learning, case-based learning, and technology-enhanced learning. A narrative for each approach examines and addresses tensions using Shulman's (2005) surface, deep and implicit structures. We argue that there is an interconnected complexity and conflicting visions among the micro- (e.g., classroom or practicum), meso- (e.g., program), and macro- (e.g., institution) levels. We acknowledge that dynamic tensions continually exist and needs to be thoughtfully navigated in support of innovative assessment and pedagogies in higher education.},

In particular, stage-based models of the creative process are discussed and the evolution of these models is traced. Empirical research suggests that the basic 4-stage model of the creative process may need to be revised or replaced. Several key questions about the creative process are raised, such as how the creative process differs from the noncreative process and how process-related differences may lead to different levels of creative performance. New directions for future research are identified.},

Most of the instructional strategies used to help students take advantage of these activities focus on supporting agile programming, which is appropriate for capstone courses. This is not always recommended in initial software engineering project courses, however, where novice developers run projects in teams while simultaneously taking other courses. To enhance the learning and teamwork experience in this latter instructional scenario, this paper proposes a formative monitoring method, reflexive weekly monitoring (RWM), for use in project courses that involve disciplined software processes and loosely coupled work. RWM uses self-reflection and collaborative learning practices to help students be aware of their individual and team performance. RWM was applied in a case study over nine consecutive semesters. The results obtained indicate that RWM was effective in enhancing the learning experience in the instructional scenario studied. While students in the monitored teams were more effective and coordinated, and experienced a higher sense of team belonging and satisfaction, little evidence was found of them being more productive than students working in non-monitored teams.},

We find that, with this platform, students spend an above average amount of time reading (compared to that reported in the literature) and that most students complete their reading assignments before class. We identify specific reading behaviors that are predictive of in-class exam performance. We also demonstrate ways that the platform promotes active reading strategies and produces high-quality learning interactions between students outside class. Finally, we compare the exam performance of two cohorts of students, where the only difference between them is the use of the platform; we show that students do significantly better on exams when using the platform.},

Despite the availability of literature reviews about gamification and its effects, no work to this date has focused exclusively on Higher Education (HE). Next, worldwide there is an increasing demand for skilled Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) professionals that meet the challenges related to scientific and technological innovations of the 21st Century. This lead to the need of strengthening STEM Higher Education. This brings us to the purpose of this work: presenting a systematic literature review of empirical studies about gamification STEM related Higher Education. This review study started from a systematic mapping design of `Web of Science' articles, with following inclusion criteria: empirical gamification studies set up in HE, published between 2000 and 2016; focusing on undergraduate or graduate students; in the STEM knowledge field, and set up in authentic settings. An initial search resulted in 562 potentially relevant articles. After applying all selection criteria, only 18 studies could be retained. 12 additional articles were included by analyzing references from earlier literature reviews, resulting in 30 studies to be included. Analysis results show how a combination of game elements (e.g. leaderboards, badges, points and other combinations) positively affects students' performance, attendance, goal orientation and attitude towards mostly computer science related subjects. The analysis results also point at a lack of studies in certain STEM areas, a lack of studies that identify the particular game element associated with the positive differential impact on student performance; a lack of validated psychometric measurements, and lack of focus on student variables that could/should be taken into account as mediating/moderating variables clarifying the impact of gamification in the HE focus on STEM learning and teaching.},

The study also investigated potential gender differences in the game's learning effectiveness and motivational appeal. The sample was 88 students, who were randomly assigned to two groups, one of which used the gaming application (Group A, N = 47) and the other one the non-gaming one (Group B, N = 41). A Computer Memory Knowledge Test (CMKT) was used as the pretest and posttest. Students were also observed during the interventions. Furthermore, after the interventions, students' views on the application they had used were elicited through a feedback questionnaire. Data analyses showed that the gaming approach was both more effective in promoting students' knowledge of computer memory concepts and more motivational than the non-gaming approach. Despite boys' greater involvement with, liking of and experience in computer gaming, and their greater initial computer memory knowledge, the learning gains that boys and girls achieved through the use of the game did not differ significantly, and the game was found to be equally motivational for boys and girls. The results suggest that within high school CS, educational computer games can be exploited as effective and motivational learning environments, regardless of students' gender.},

Peer review is one method to encourage this by providing students with the opportunity to evaluate other people's work and to receive feedback on their own projects. This allows for rich learning experience but it is not immediately obvious how to create a programming project review that will improve the students' conceptual understanding, require higher level thinking, and be engaging. The current literature does not typically address differences between review implementations or provide reasons for design decisions. This work explored how two different types of reviews affected the students' learning of concepts, high-level thinking, and engagement. There were indications that the type of review affected how well students addressed the concept they were reviewing and the comments' length. This shows that the review's type may affect student engagement and conceptual learning. There were also differences in how they reviewed the concepts of Abstraction, Decomposition, and Encapsulation, suggesting that the concepts are being learned in different ways. Both of these results have an impact on the use of peer review computer science but need further investigation.},

PI has been shown to increase learning in STEM disciplines such as physics and biology. In this report we look at another indicator of student success the rate at which students pass the course or, conversely, the rate at which they fail. Evaluating 10 years of instruction of 4 different courses spanning 16 PI course instances, we find that adoption of the PI methodology in the classroom reduces fail rates by a per-course average of 61\% (20\% reduced to 7\%) compared to standard instruction (SI). Moreover, we also find statistically significant improvements within-instructor. For the same instructor teaching the same course, we find PI decreases the fail rate, on average, by 67\% (from 23\% to 8\%) compared to SI. As an in-situ study, we discuss the various threats to the validity of this work and consider implications of wide-spread adoption of PI in computing programs.},

There are two major types of constructivism in the classroom: (1) Cognitive or individual constructivism depending on Piaget's theory, and (2) Social constructivism depending on Vygotsky's theory. Similarities include inquiry teaching methods and students creating concepts built on existing knowledge that are relevant and meaningful. Differences include language development theory where thinking precedes language for cognitive constructivism and language precedes thinking for the theory of social constructivism. Understanding communicative tools and strategies helps teachers to develop individual learning methods such as, discovery learning, and social interactive to develop peer collaboration.},

These gaps between the abilities of graduating students and those expectations can prevent them from succeeding in their careers. This paper presents the results of a systematic literature review conducted to determine which areas graduating students most frequently fall short of the expectations of industry or academia. The results of this review indicate that graduating students are lacking in many different areas, including technical abilities (design, testing, configuration management tools, etc.) personal skills (oral and written communication, teamwork, etc.) and professional qualities (e.g. ethics). By raising awareness of these areas, it is possible for educators to become aware of areas where students most frequently fail to meet expectations and to make curriculum changes or other adjustments to address these problems.},

A pilot study found that while two common Learning Management Systems had different tools, faculty varied widely in their use and perception of the affordances of the tools. In the subsequent quantitative study, surveys were administered to 605 online students in a large Midwestern university. Regression analysis found that perceived LMS affordances predicted teaching, cognitive and social presence among students; in addition, satisfaction with the LMS predicted course satisfaction.},

Agreement emerges among investigators for most contingency effects when experimental procedures are referred to using a standardized terminology. However, some discrepancies are apparent, especially with respect to performance-contingent effects that have both increased and decreased intrinsic motivation relative to task-contingent effects. These discrepancies are discussed in terms of cognitive evaluation theory (Deci \& Ryan, 1980), and an integration of the various effects is proposed and tested using male and female college students (N = 96) working on a puzzle-solving activity for whom various reward conditions were in effect. The results of the study and review suggest that it is the relative salience of controlling and informational aspects of rewards that mediate the contingency effects. The review and study underscore the importance of the interpersonal context of reward administration for the facilitation or undermining of intrinsic motivation.},

In these theories, emotions and beliefs are thought to elicit different patterns of behaviour such as pursuit of mastery, failure avoidance, learned helplessness and passive aggression.

To a large extent this change was caused by the online education. A rapid growth of online university programs raises a number of new pedagogical, psychological and social issues. Online learning creates a learning environment that, compared to traditional, classroom-based education, is less personal, more independent, often fragmented, rarely systemic, distributed in space and time, and dependent on the learner rather than on the teacher. Many problems with online education (high attrition rate, orientation at highly skilled and highly motivated people, among other issues (The Trouble with Online College, 2013), indicate that one of its major challenges is not the technology itself or its classroom applications, but the lack of sound, research-based theoretical framework as the foundation of quality online learning. A comprehensive and effective educational theory is thus crucial for the quality education. This article makes an argument for such a theory and offers a model of online pedagogy for higher education with a focus on instruction and instructor, student autonomy, socialization through networking and collaboration in the online learning environment.},

  abstract = {In peer instruction, instructors pose a challenging question to students, students answer the question individually, students work with a partner in the class to discuss their answers, and finally students answer the question again. A large body of evidence shows that peer instruction benefits student learning. To determine the mechanism for these benefits, we collected semester-long data from six classes, involving a total of 208 undergraduate students being asked a total of 86 different questions related to their course content. For each question, students chose their answer individually, reported their confidence, discussed their answers with their partner, and then indicated their possibly revised answer and confidence again. Overall, students were more accurate and confident after discussion than before. Initially correct students were more likely to keep their answers than initially incorrect students, and this tendency was partially but not completely attributable to differences in confidence. We discuss the benefits of peer instruction in terms of differences in the coherence of explanations, social learning, and the contextual factors that influence confidence and accuracy.},

We discuss the efficacy of various policies for collaboration with regard to student education, and we consider a number of strategies for mitigating dishonest behaviour on computer science coursework by addressing some common causes. Computer science coursework is somewhat unique, in that there often exist ideal solutions for problems, and work may be shared and copied with very little effort. We discuss the idiosyncratic nature of how collaboration, collusion and plagiarism are defined and perceived by students, instructors and administration. After considering some of the common reasons for dishonest behaviour among students, we look at some methods that have been suggested for mitigating them. Finally, we propose several ideas for improving computer science courses in this context. We suggest emphasizing the intended learning outcomes of each assignment, providing tutorial sessions to facilitate acceptable collaboration, delivering quizzes related to assignment content after each assignment is submitted, and clarifying the boundary between collaboration and collusion in the context of each course. While this discussion is directed at the computer science community, much may apply to other disciplines as well, particularly those with a similar nature such as engineering, other sciences, or mathematics.},

Concepts and differences between techniques and methods of game-mechanics and game dynamics are explained. With proper integration of gamification in the field of e-learning into higher education, a positive impact on the learning process can be achieved, such as higher satisfaction, motivation and greater engagement of students. The importance of clearly defined objectives, rules, techniques and mechanisms of gamification that affect the dynamics of the students is shown. The paper presents a comprehensive view of the gamification concept in higher education. The advantages and disadvantages of introducing gamification in e-learning are described. The paper combines the characteristics of gamification with e-learning and shows the possibilities of use in practical.},

Understanding learners' and instructors' perceptions of their proficiency and use of ICTs is critical to the success of their integration in universities. Using a theoretical framework grounded in technology integration and educational psychology, survey data were collected from students and instructors spanning 12 Quebec universities. Results show that, for instructors, the efficacy of ICT use, and constructivist, interactive forms of teaching most strongly predict a positive perception of the classroom learning experience. Meanwhile, for students, stimulating lectures are the chief predictors of their learning appreciation. Directions for future research are discussed in light of the results of this study.},

  abstract = {Using games in education has the potential to increase students' motivation and engagement in the learning process, gathering long-lasting practical knowledge. Expanding interest in implementing a game-based approach in computer science education highlights the need for a comprehensive overview of the literature research. This scoping review aims to provide insight into current trends and identify research gaps and potential research topics concerning game-based learning in computer science. Using standard methodology for scoping review, we identified 113 articles from four digital libraries published between 2017 and 2021. Those articles were analyzed concerning the educational level, type of the game, computer science topic covered by the game, pedagogical strategies, and purpose for implementing this approach in different educational levels. The results show that the number of research articles has increased through the years, confirming the importance of implementing a game-based approach in computer science. Different kinds of games, using different technology, concerning different computer science topics are presented in the research. The obtained results indicate that there is no standardized game or standardized methodology that can be used for the creation of an educational game for computer science education. Analyzed articles mainly implement a game-based approach using learning by playing, and no significant focus is given to the effectiveness of learning by designing a game as a pedagogical strategy. Moreover, the approach is mainly implemented for developing computational thinking or programming skills, highlighting the need for its implementation in other topics beyond programming.},
