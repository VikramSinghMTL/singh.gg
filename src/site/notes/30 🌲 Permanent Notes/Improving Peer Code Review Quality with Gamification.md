[[Peer code review\|Peer code review]] is a fundamental part of being a professional software developer [@li2006, p. 9]. This is a process that is commonly enacted when a developer wants to make a change to the already existing codebase. One or more of their teammates will evaluate and make suggestions on the code based on an agreed upon style guide and general coding best practices. The developer then has to implement the feedback from their peers. This process is critical in the quality assurance of the application. Despite this requirement, the research suggests that students lack [[30 üå≤ Permanent Notes/Motivation\|Motivation]] to give quality peer feedback during the code review process [@indriasari2021a]. To give quality peer feedback, students must be engaged in the process. The literature states that [[30 üå≤ Permanent Notes/Constructivism\|students learn better by doing]] than by passively listening [@powell2009] and that students can deepen their own learning through [[10 üçÉ Fleeting Notes/Peer Assessment\|Peer Assessment]] [@race2001].

One significant area of research dedicated to increasing student motivation is _[[30 üå≤ Permanent Notes/Gamification\|Gamification]]_ which has been correlated to achieve more effective [[learning outcomes\|learning outcomes]] and motivation [@ahmad2020a; @butler2016]. @goshevski2017 differentiates [[rewards-based gamified experiences\|rewards-based gamified experiences]] (badges, points, levels, etc.) with [[meaningful experiences\|meaningful experiences]] (engagement, play, exposition, choice, information and reflection). Rewards-based gamified experiences are used extensively throughout the literature to implement gamified learning experiences [@ahmad2020a; @garcia-iruela2020; @ibanez2014a]. Further, a meta-analysis by @oktaviati2018 found that badges, points, levels, and leaderboards are the most used gamified strategies used in Computer Science classrooms. Goshevski explains that these rewards-based experiences are directly tied to [[extrinsic motivation\|extrinsic motivation]], and meaningful experiences are tied to [[intrinsic motivation\|intrinsic motivation]]. According to @seifert2004, "students characterized by [intrinsic motivation] tend to display positive affect, flexible and adaptive strategy use, and deep cognitive engagement in the task. They will tend to persist at difÔ¨Åcult problems and learn from their mistakes." This makes the pursuit of intrinsic motivation a valuable one.

One of the only studies about gamifying the peer code review process for Computer Science students by @indriasari2023 found that it indeed led to better quality feedback. However, the methods they used in their experiment used mostly rewards-based gamified experiences. Indriasari states that "exploring more sophisticated game element designs with mechanics that are better targeted to influence review quality would be another useful avenue to explore in the future." In other words, it would be valuable to explore the impact that a more meaningful gamified experience would have on the peer code review process. With the results, Computer Science students can graduate not only having strong peer code review skills, but an increased sense of engagement through the gamified peer feedback experience.
