- Badges and levels ([[Extrinsic Motivation\|Extrinsic Motivation]]) vs stories and narrative ([[Intrinsic Motivation\|Intrinsic Motivation]]).
    - Rewards based gamification vs meaning based gamification
- Many studies mention [[30 ðŸŒ² Permanent Notes/Self-Determination Theory\|self-determinism theory]].
- All the studies so far outline how to do gamification in the classroom and report their results with the platforms they used.
- Gamification generally seems to get positive results in the conclusion and data sections.
- I feel like this can only work well if the game is tightly coupled to the learning objectives. Like, slapping a kahoot onto something and calling it gamification seems disingenuous. However, lots of people report success with kahoot so who am I.

## Ideas

- Debugging race/escape room type game where they have to debug and the answer to the bugs gives them different weapons or keys they can use to defeat the boss and escape.
- Space invaders style game where they have to shoot the proper parameter to a function or evaluate a line or something.
- Something with Scrimba? Not sure since it's not really gamey.
- RPG Maker where they can walk around talking to NPCs... Something with narrative.
- Code katta/advent of code style problems.
- A Papers Please style game where the player plays as a literal code reviewer at some big faceless corporation.
    - The student can create their own programmer avatar.
    - Their supervisor hands them 3-5 codebases to be assessed.
    - The assessment can be run through a LLM to look for elements based on the Hamer framework of general, specific, positive, negative etc. types of feedback.
        - Ask Indriasari for their data and platform
    - It will also use the Moodle algorithm for grading an assessment based on deviation from the mean.
    - Based on the quality of the feedback, the player is awarded money with which they have to feed their family, keeps the lights on, etc.
        - Maybe they could buy things to decorate their desk?
    - The student can also rate if the feedback was useful which will also affect the user's grade.
    - The leaderboard would be a list of character names/avatars. The student can choose to toggle their real name on if they wish to be identified in the leaderboard.
