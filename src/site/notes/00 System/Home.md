👋🏽 Hello there!

I'm a software developer turned computer science teacher, with a passion for [[coding\|coding]] and [[education\|education]]. This is my [[digital garden\|digital garden]] where I plant seeds of thought, let them grow (or sometimes wilt), and occasionally prune them into something more polished. You’ll find a mix of half-baked thoughts, polished ideas, and everything in between. The aim is to weed out perfectionism and embrace the organic, messy process of learning. So, dig in, wander around, and and watch as things grow and evolve over time.
