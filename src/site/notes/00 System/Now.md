Right [now](https://nownownow.com/about) I'm teaching 420-5P6 Game Programming and helping teachings with educational technology through my role as Faculty Resource Person at [John Abbott College](https://johnabbott.qc.ca) for the Fall 2024 semester. I'm also in the research phase of my Master's of Education degree at the [University of Sherbrooke](https://usherbrooke.ca). My research topic is _improving computer science students' motivation to provide quality peer code review through game-based learning_. I'm trying to design the game intervention I'll use on (with?) my students to collect my data.
