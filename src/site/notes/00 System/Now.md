Right [now](https://nownownow.com/about) I'm helping teachers with educational technology through my role as Faculty Resource Person at [John Abbott College](https://johnabbott.qc.ca) for the Winter 2025 semester.

I'm also in the research phase of my Master's of Education degree at the [University of Sherbrooke](https://usherbrooke.ca). My research topic is _improving computer science students' motivation to provide quality peer code review through game-based learning_. I collected my data last semester by having my students play a card game I designed where their initial hand is determined by the quality of [[30 Permanent Notes/Peer Feedback and Gamification\|peer feedback]] they gave in the last assignment. The first time they played the game, they were unaware as to why their peers had different cards than them. The second time they played the game, they were aware, and my job now is to compare the feedback from the first round to the second round, as see if the game had any impact on the quality of feedback. Now I'm crunching the numbers and writing up the final thesis to hopefully submit by the end of this semester!

Finally, I got tired of endlessly exporting/importing grades between platforms. So, instead of actually grading, I created a bookmarklet that makes it easier to extract grades from Moodle and copy them into Lea’s “Import Results” page.
