## Perusall <!-- element class="r-fit-text" -->

### A Research-Based Approach <!-- element class="r-fit-text" -->

note: Welcome everyone! Today, I’ll show how Perusall is more than just a reading tool—it's grounded in strong pedagogical frameworks that enhance learning in meaningful ways.

<!-- slide data-auto-animate data-auto-animate-id="challenge" -->

## The Challenge

note: Many educators struggle with student engagement in assigned readings. Traditional methods don’t always provide insights into student thinking, and discussions can feel disconnected from the material.

## The Challenge

<split left="3" right="1" gap="1">

::: block <!-- element class="icon-list" -->

- <i class="fas fa-book-open"/> Without structured support, students may **skim readings** without deep engagement or reflection.
+ <i class="fas fa-comments"/> Traditional forums often feel **disconnected from the text**, making it difficult to sustain meaningful dialogue.
+ <i class="fas fa-eye-slash"/> Instructors struggle to **assess cognitive engagement**, as passive reading leaves little trace of understanding.

## The Solution

note: Perusall transforms reading into an interactive, social experience. Students discuss concepts directly within the text, allowing instructors to track engagement and identify gaps in understanding.

## Let's Try It

1. In your browser, type in [bit.ly/jac-moodle-login](https://bit.ly/jac-moodle-login). You can find the link in the chat or in the email that was sent out earlier.
2. User: first.last (ex. `wilma.brown`, all lowercase).
3. Pass: First name + 123! (ex. `Dianne123!`, first letter uppercase).
4. Once logged in, click on "My Courses" at the top, then "Pedagogy of Digital Learning".
5. Click "Perusall".

## The Task

::: block <!-- element class="icon-list" -->

- <i class="far fa-hand-point-right"/> **Choose** a *learning objective* from the course outline that stands out to you.
- <i class="fas fa-highlighter"/> ==**Highlight**== and write an *annotation* explaining either:
	- A **question** you have about its meaning or application.
	- A **connection** to your teaching experience.
	- A **suggestion** on how it could be clarified or expanded.
- <i class="fas fa-reply"/> **Reply** to at least one other annotation to build discussion.

:::

note: This slide explains the task to participants. They will annotate a course learning objective in Perusall and engage with their peers' annotations to create a meaningful discussion.

## Community of Inquiry

<split even gap="1">

::: block <!-- element class="fragment" -->

<i class="fas fa-brain fa-2x"/>

**Cognitive Presence**

::: block <!-- element style="font-size: 0.75em;" -->

Perusall turns reading into an **iterative process of inquiry**, moving beyond passive text consumption.

:::

:::

::: block <!-- element class="fragment" -->

<i class="fas fa-users fa-2x"/>

**Social Presence**

::: block <!-- element style="font-size: 0.75em;" -->

Students develop a **sense of community** by interacting with peers in an engaging, low-stakes environment.

:::

:::

::: block <!-- element class="fragment" -->

<i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher fa-2x"/>

**Teaching Presence**

::: block <!-- element style="font-size: 0.75em;" -->

Teachers can **scaffold learning** by embedding guiding questions and responding to student insights.

</split>

note: The **Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework** emphasizes deep and meaningful online learning. Perusall supports all three presences by making reading an interactive, social experience.
