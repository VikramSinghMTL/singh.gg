- Theoretical Frameworks
    - Lazzaro identiﬁes four keys to unlocking players’ emotions: 1) providing opportunities for challenge, strategy, and problem solving (hard fun); 2) introducing elements that foster mystery, intrigue, and curiosity (easy fun); 3) leading players to excitement or relief moods (altered states); and 4) promoting competition and teamwork (people fun).
    - The taxonomy also states the need to provide feedback and information about progress as well as the social and competitive elements necessary to promote learners’ engagement.
- Type of Research & Variables Studied
    - Mixed methods
    - sensation, fantasy, narrative, challenge, fellowship, discovery, expression, and submission.

    - Pre and post test questionnaires to measure knowledge acquisition.
    - Open-ended questionnaire to measure preferences and motivations.
    - Non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
    - Parametric t-test.
- Comments
    - Good example of mixed methods in action.
    - They did not distinguish between intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation and acknowledged more research needs to be done here.

        - It captures the activities that may occur during a student peer review process. The circular nodes represent the different roles that students adopt. The rectangular nodes symbolize objects. The arcs represent actions taken by students, mediated through the peer review system.
- Type of Research & Variables Studied
    - I think this is quantitative since they're not doing any surveys? It's all about coding attributes from several articles and analyzing the trends.
    - Literature review
- Instruments & Measures
    - Points, leaderboards, badges, progress bars, levels, prizes.
    - Engagement, Contentment, Correlation between peer review activities and performance, Correlation between the difficulty of activity and reward, Creation of learning communities, Performance.
- Comments
    - Is this what they call a meta-analysis?
    - Automated vs manual reward allocation reminds me of the gam "Paper, Please?"
    - Using an LLM to assess the quality of feedback must be so trivial these days with AI. Something to look into.
    - Authors mention further research on the gamification of tasks involving peer review of source code is warranted.

    - The survey included two Likert-scale questions and an open-ended question, as follows:
        1. SQ1. “Overall, I found that the feedback that I received was useful to me.”
        2. SQ2. “Overall, I think the feedback that I provided would be useful for my peers.”
        3. SQ3. “Please comment on the quality of feedback you read during peer code review.”
- Comments
    - Low motivation has been linked to substandard review quality. This makes the review process a great place to try gamification!
    - The authors mention that exploring a more sophisticated game design would beneficial to research. Perhaps I would want to look into this, but creating more complex games will take a ton of time.

## [@butler2016]

- Topic & Problem
    - High attrition rate for Computer Science students.
    - Student motivation.
- Research Questions
    - How to develop engaging and interactive learning games based on the needs of CS students?
- Theoretical Frameworks

    - The less the game seems like an "education game" and more like an actual game, the more likely students are to engage. This is challenging though because creating a game takes a lot of resources.

- Type of Research & Variables Studied
    - Qualitative meta-analysis.
- Instruments & Measures
    - Whether the article mentioned any of: Badges, points, levels, leaderboards, tasks, timers, countdowns, avatars, trophies, challenges, storylines, virtual reality.
- Comments
    - Gamification can be used in places that students find the material boring or repetitive.
    - There seems to be a difference between using gameplay elements vs. using an actual game to teach a concept.
