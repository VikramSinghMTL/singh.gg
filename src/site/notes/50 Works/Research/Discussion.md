## 5.1 Summary of Findings

This study investigated whether a game-based learning (GBL) intervention could improve the quality of peer feedback provided during peer code review (PCR) and enhance students’ perceptions of autonomy, competence, and relatedness as conceptualized by Self-Determination Theory (SDT). The results indicate that the intervention significantly improved the quality of peer feedback, as evidenced by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test ($W = 42.0$, $z = -4.67$, $p = .0018$). Additionally, students reported high levels of enjoyment for the peer feedback card game ($M = 4.79$, $Mdn = 5.0$), suggesting strong engagement. However, while the intervention led to a statistically significant increase in autonomy ($t = -2.54$, $p = 0.013$), it did not produce significant changes in competence ($t = -0.39$, $p = 0.695$) or relatedness ($t = -2.00$, $p = 0.058$). Qualitative responses provided further insights into how students perceived the impact of the game on their motivation and engagement with the peer feedback process.

## 5.2 Interpretation Through the Lens of SDT

### 5.2.1 Autonomy

While the results showed a statistically significant increase in autonomy, further analysis suggests that this finding should be interpreted with caution. The ambiguity in the phrasing of the pre-test question (*'I feel in control of the peer feedback I provide'*) and the post-test question (*'The card game made me feel more in control of the peer feedback I gave'*) likely influenced student responses. The latter introduces the game as a direct factor, which may have altered how students interpreted 'control'—either as decision-making flexibility or as external structuring imposed by the game. Additionally, the inclusion of anxiety as a reverse-scored item in the autonomy measure may have confounded results. These inconsistencies suggest that the observed increase in autonomy could partly reflect measurement artifacts rather than a true motivational shift. Future studies should ensure clearer and more consistent wording to avoid such biases. One of the autonomy-related survey questions differed in wording between the pre- and post-test, potentially influencing responses and creating ambiguity around how students perceived their level of control in the feedback process. Additionally, anxiety was reverse-scored and included in the autonomy category, which may have impacted the overall measurement. According to SDT, autonomy is enhanced when individuals feel that their actions are self-directed and personally meaningful (Deci & Ryan, 1994). The game allowed students to make strategic choices about their feedback and engage in a self-paced review process, which likely contributed to the observed increase in autonomy. However, future studies should refine the measurement of autonomy to ensure that wording consistency and potential confounding variables are addressed. This aligns with findings from previous research indicating that game mechanics that provide choice and agency can enhance intrinsic motivation in learning environments (Papastergiou, 2009; Indriasari et al., 2023).

### 5.2.2 Competence

Despite improvements in feedback quality, students did not report a statistically significant increase in perceived competence. One possible explanation is that students’ self-perception of competence did not align with the actual improvements in their feedback quality. While the game encouraged more detailed peer feedback, students may not have felt that their evaluation skills had meaningfully improved. Research suggests that competence is best supported when learners receive clear performance indicators and structured guidance (Bandura, 2012; Hattie & Timperley, 2007). Future iterations of the game could integrate scaffolding mechanisms, such as detailed rubrics, worked examples, or formative feedback sessions, to help students recognize and internalize their skill development. Additionally, direct comparison between students' feedback before and after the game could help them see tangible improvements, reinforcing their sense of competence. Some students indicated that while they engaged more deeply with peer feedback, they did not necessarily feel more skilled. One student reflected, *"Yes, the card game influenced me to give more feedback but up to a certain degree. I wouldn’t go too out of my way, but if it was an easy bug fix that I could provide, I would give them the feedback on it."* This suggests that while the game provided external motivation, it may not have fully supported skill development in a way that led to a stronger sense of competence. One possible explanation is that while the game motivated students to engage more with the feedback process, it did not necessarily provide sufficient scaffolding for them to feel more skilled or effective in evaluating their peers' code (Bandura, 2012; Hattie & Timperley, 2007). Future iterations of the game could incorporate more explicit instructional supports, such as structured rubrics or exemplars of high-quality feedback, to help students recognize and develop their feedback skills.

### 5.2.3 Relatedness

Although relatedness did not show a statistically significant improvement, qualitative responses indicated that some students found the game to be an enjoyable and engaging social experience, while others did not perceive a strong connection between the game and peer interactions. The competitive nature of the game may have contributed to this outcome, as competition can sometimes emphasize individual performance over collaboration. Pre-test data indicated that while 22 students preferred competitive games, 8 preferred cooperative games, and 12 had no preference. This suggests that while the competitive format may have aligned with some students' gaming preferences, it may not have been as engaging for those who prefer collaborative experiences. The majority of students (39 out of 42) reported enjoying video games, with 26 specifically enjoying card games, suggesting a general familiarity with gaming structures that may have influenced engagement. However, while 40 out of 42 students were at least somewhat familiar with card games, two students had no familiarity, which could have impacted their ability to engage fully with the mechanics of the intervention. One student mentioned, *"The game made me a bit competitive, which affected the way I gave feedback to have a better chance of winning the card game."* However, others felt neutral or even pressured, with one stating, *"After the card game, I felt that the bar for effort in grading was set from our previous results. It put pressure to either match how we graded previously or improve, while discouraging doing any less than that."* These mixed responses highlight the need to balance competitive and cooperative elements in future iterations of the intervention. Pre-test responses suggest that social interaction (26 responses) was an important factor in why students enjoy games, yet the competitive nature of the card game may not have fully supported that preference for all students. This finding reflects prior research suggesting that relatedness in peer review contexts is highly dependent on the design of collaborative interactions (Powell & Kalina, 2009). The competitive nature of the game may have increased motivation for some students but may not have fostered the sense of interpersonal connection necessary to enhance relatedness. This is further supported by pre-test data, which showed that while a majority of students preferred playing games with others (27 out of 42), a smaller group either had no preference (11) or preferred playing alone (4). Additionally, students’ preference for competitive vs. cooperative gaming may have influenced their engagement with the intervention. The pre-test results indicated that 22 students preferred competitive games, while 8 preferred cooperative games, and 12 had no preference. Since the intervention was designed as a competitive game, it may have aligned more closely with the motivational preferences of those who enjoy competition while being less engaging for students who favour cooperative play. Adjustments such as incorporating team-based elements or emphasizing cooperative strategies may help strengthen students’ social engagement in future iterations of the intervention. Future iterations of the intervention could explore hybrid game mechanics, such as team-based challenges or cooperative feedback activities, to ensure that students who thrive in collaborative environments also feel socially connected through the game-based peer review process.

## 5.3 Game-Based Learning and Peer Code Review

The positive impact of the intervention on feedback quality and student engagement supports the viability of game-based learning as an approach for improving PCR in CS education. This aligns with research comparing gamification and GBL, which suggests that while gamification often relies on extrinsic motivators, GBL fosters intrinsic engagement by embedding learning within game mechanics (Jayasinghe & Dharmaratne, 2013; Goshevski et al., 2017). By applying these principles to PCR, this study highlights how fully game-based approaches can drive engagement beyond traditional gamified elements such as points and leaderboards. However, fewer studies have examined the use of fully game-based approaches for PCR. Research on GBL in CS education has shown that embedding learning objectives within meaningful game mechanics can lead to greater intrinsic motivation and deeper engagement (Lopez-Fernandez et al., 2021; Videnovik et al., 2023). By applying these principles to PCR, this study builds upon existing work and highlights the potential of GBL as an alternative to traditional gamification strategies. Future research should further compare the relative effectiveness of GBL and gamification-based peer review interventions to determine which approach better supports student engagement and feedback quality. Pre-test data revealed that most students had limited prior experience with game-based learning, with 24 students reporting that they had participated rarely and 10 stating they had never engaged in GBL before. This suggests that the intervention was a novel experience for many students, potentially influencing their engagement and perception of the approach. Prior research suggests that novelty can contribute to initial motivation spikes (Papastergiou, 2009), but future studies should investigate whether the engagement persists over multiple iterations of game-based peer feedback. Pre-test data on students' gaming preferences further supports this, as the majority of students cited relaxation/fun (38 responses), strategic thinking (31), problem-solving (30), and competition (29) as primary reasons for enjoying games. Additionally, most students reported playing games frequently, with 17 playing weekly and 14 playing daily. This suggests that a game-based approach aligns well with their existing habits and interests. One student noted, *"100%, before I only put ‘good job’ or ‘error in x.js’ but now I went in-depth knowing it would give me an edge while playing the game."* Another student noted, *"It gave me an incentive to put more effort and details into my peer feedback than before."* This aligns with previous research on gamification, which suggests that competitive mechanics can encourage greater engagement in peer assessment (Indriasari et al., 2023). Previous studies on gamification have demonstrated that incorporating points, leaderboards, and competitive elements can increase motivation and participation in peer review (Indriasari et al., 2020a; Indriasari et al., 2021b). However, this study builds on these findings by demonstrating that a fully game-based approach—rather than isolated game elements—can lead to significant improvements in feedback quality.

This aligns with the broader body of research on GBL in CS education, which highlights that embedding learning objectives within engaging and meaningful game mechanics can lead to greater intrinsic motivation and deeper engagement with course content (Lopez-Fernandez et al., 2021; Videnovik et al., 2023). While gamification typically relies on extrinsic rewards, GBL fosters intrinsic motivation by making the activity itself engaging (Al-Azawi et al., 2016; Papastergiou, 2009). The findings from this study suggest that GBL may offer an effective alternative to traditional gamification approaches in the context of peer feedback.

## 5.4 Comparison to Existing Research

The results contribute to the growing body of literature on student motivation in peer review and GBL in CS education. Prior research has shown that PCR is often hindered by low engagement and superficial feedback, with many students providing minimal comments or vague evaluations (Hamer et al., 2009; Petersen & Zingaro, 2018; Indriasari et al., 2020a). By integrating game mechanics into the peer code review process, this study helped increase student engagement and led to more detailed and constructive feedback. This finding aligns with prior research on gamified learning environments, which suggests that incorporating competitive and strategic elements can enhance motivation and participation. By embedding PCR within a game structure, this study successfully addressed this motivational barrier, leading to more detailed and constructive feedback.

The study also provides new insights into how different game mechanics influence SDT constructs. While prior studies on gamification have shown improvements in motivation (Indriasari et al., 2023), they have not necessarily explored whether game elements foster autonomy, competence, and relatedness. This study suggests that while GBL can effectively enhance autonomy and engagement, additional design considerations may be needed to support competence and relatedness.

## 5.5 Limitations and Future Research

### 5.5.1 Sample Size and Context

While the study demonstrated statistically significant improvements in feedback quality and autonomy, the findings are based on a limited sample size within a specific CS course. Future research should explore larger and more diverse student populations, including students from different institutions, varying levels of programming experience, and diverse class structures, to determine whether the effects generalize across different CS education contexts.

### 5.5.2 Measuring Long-Term Impact

The study focused on immediate changes in feedback quality and motivation. However, it remains unclear whether these improvements persist over time. Longitudinal studies could investigate whether GBL interventions lead to sustained improvements in PCR habits beyond a single semester.

### 5.5.3 Enhancing Competence and Relatedness

To address the lack of significant changes in competence and relatedness, future iterations of the game could integrate:
- Competence-building supports, such as scaffolding mechanisms, structured feedback templates, or expert-generated example reviews.
- Collaborative gameplay mechanics, such as peer mentoring or cooperative review challenges, to foster stronger social connections between students.

### 5.5.4 Comparing GBL to Traditional Gamification

Finally, future research should compare GBL-based peer review interventions to more traditional gamification approaches (e.g., leaderboards and point-based systems) to determine which method is most effective for improving PCR outcomes.

## 5.6 Conclusion

This study provides evidence that game-based learning can enhance the quality of peer feedback and increase student autonomy in PCR within CS education. While no significant changes were observed in competence or relatedness, the game was widely enjoyed, and qualitative responses suggest that it influenced students’ engagement with the feedback process. These findings contribute to ongoing research on student motivation in peer review and GBL in CS education, highlighting the potential of fully game-based approaches as an alternative to traditional gamification strategies. Future research should explore how game mechanics can be further optimized to support competence and relatedness, ensuring that GBL interventions provide comprehensive motivational benefits for all students.
