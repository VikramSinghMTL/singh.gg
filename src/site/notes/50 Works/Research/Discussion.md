This study investigated whether a GBL intervention could improve the quality of peer feedback provided during PCR and enhance students' perceptions of autonomy, competence, and relatedness, as conceptualized by SDT. The results indicate a statistically significant improvement in feedback quality ($W=42.0$, $z=-3.09$, $p=.002$) and autonomy ($t=-2.46$, $p=.016$), alongside high levels of enjoyment for the peer feedback card game ($M=4.79$, $Mdn=5.0$). However, competence ($t=-0.54$, $p=.592$) and relatedness ($t=-1.92$, $p=.058$) did not show statistically significant improvements. Qualitative responses provided further insights into how students perceived the game's influence on their motivation and engagement with the peer feedback process.

## Interpretation Through the Lens of SDT

### Autonomy

The increase in autonomy suggested that the game created a more engaging and self-directed review process. However, this result should be interpreted with caution due to potential response bias in survey wording. The pre-test question (*"I feel in control of the peer feedback I provide"*) and the post-test question (*"The card game made me feel more in control of the peer feedback I gave"*) differed in phrasing, explicitly introducing the game in the latter. This may have influenced how students interpreted "control", either as greater decision-making flexibility or as external structuring imposed by the game.

Despite these concerns, SDT suggests that autonomy is enhanced when individuals feel their actions are self-directed and meaningful [@deci1994]. The game allowed students to make strategic choices about their feedback and engage in a self-paced review process, which likely contributed to the observed increase in autonomy. Prior research has shown that game mechanics that promote player agency can enhance intrinsic motivation in learning environments [@indriasari2023; @papastergiou2009]. Future iterations of the intervention should refine survey wording and explore additional mechanisms for reinforcing student autonomy.

### Competence

Although feedback quality improved significantly, students did not report a corresponding increase in perceived competence. One possible explanation is that their self-perception did not align with actual improvements in their feedback. While the game encouraged more detailed peer reviews, students may not have felt that their evaluation skills had meaningfully improved. Research suggests that competence is best supported when learners receive clear performance indicators and structured guidance [@bandura2012; @hattie2007].

Some students indicated that while they engaged more deeply in peer feedback, they did not necessarily feel more skilled. One student reflected, *"Yes, the card game influenced me to give more feedback but up to a certain degree. I wouldn't go too out of my way, but if it was an easy bug fix that I could provide, I would give them the feedback on it."* This suggests that while the game motivated participation, it may not have fully supported skill development in a way that led to a stronger sense of competence.

To better support competence, future iterations could incorporate scaffolding mechanisms such as detailed rubrics, worked examples, or formative feedback sessions. Direct comparisons between students' feedback before and after the game could also help them see tangible improvements, reinforcing their sense of competence.

### Relatedness

While relatedness did not show a statistically significant improvement, qualitative responses revealed mixed experiences. Some students found the game engaging and social, while others did not see a strong connection between the game and peer interactions. The competitive nature of the game may have contributed to this, as competition can sometimes emphasize individual performance over collaboration. Pre-test data showed that 52% of students preferred competitive games, 20% preferred cooperative games, and 28% had no preference. While the competitive format aligned with some students' preferences, it may have been less engaging for those who favour collaborative experiences.

Pre-test data further supports this distinction, showing that while most students (64%) preferred playing games with others, 26% had no preference, and only 10% preferred playing alone. Additionally, students' familiarity with gaming may have influenced engagement as most students (93%) reported enjoying video games, and 62% specifically enjoyed card games. However, two students had no familiarity with card games, which may have impacted their ability to fully engage with the mechanics of the intervention.

One student noted, *"The game made me a bit competitive, which affected the way I gave feedback to have a better chance of winning the card game."* Others, however, felt neutral or pressured, with one stating, *"After the card game, I felt that the bar for effort in grading was set from our previous results. It put pressure to either match how we graded previously or improve, while discouraging doing any less than that."* These mixed responses highlight the need to balance competition and cooperation in future iterations of the intervention.

To foster greater social connection, future iterations could introduce hybrid game mechanics, such as team-based challenges or cooperative feedback activities. This aligns with prior research suggesting that relatedness in peer review depends on how collaborative interactions are designed [@powell2009].

## Game-Based Learning in Peer Code Review

The positive impact of the intervention on feedback quality and student engagement supports the potential of GBL as an effective approach for improving PCR in CS education. This aligns with research comparing gamification and GBL, which suggests that while gamification often relies on extrinsic motivators, GBL fosters intrinsic engagement by embedding learning within game mechanics [@jayasinghe2013; @goshevski2017]. Unlike gamification, which applies external rewards to an existing task, GBL integrates the learning process into the mechanics of the game itself, making engagement more sustained and meaningful.

Student reflections reinforced this connection between game mechanics and engagement. One student noted, *"100%, before I only put ‘good job' or ‘error in x.js' but now I went in-depth knowing it would give me an edge while playing the game."* Another remarked, *"It gave me an incentive to put more effort and details into my peer feedback than before."* These responses align with research on gamification, which suggests that competitive mechanics can encourage greater engagement in peer assessment [@indriasari2023]. Prior studies have demonstrated that incorporating points, leaderboards, and competitive elements can increase motivation in peer review [@indriasari2020a; @indriasari2021a], but this study builds on those findings by demonstrating that a fully game-based approach can lead to significant improvements in feedback quality [@ardic2025].

## Limitations and Future Directions

Although the study demonstrated statistically significant improvements in feedback quality and autonomy, several limitations must be considered. The study was conducted within a single CS course with a limited sample size, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Future research should examine larger and more diverse student populations across different institutions and programming experience levels.

Additionally, the novelty of the intervention may have influenced engagement. Pre-test data indicated that most students had limited prior experience with GBL, with 24 students reporting that they had rarely participated in game-based learning and 10 stating they had never engaged in it before. Prior research suggests that novelty can contribute to initial motivation spikes [@papastergiou2009], but further studies should investigate whether engagement persists over multiple iterations.

Finally, the lack of significant changes in competence and relatedness suggests areas for improvement. Future iterations of the game could incorporate additional scaffolding (e.g., structured rubrics, guided reflection exercises) to reinforce competence and introduce collaborative game mechanics (e.g., peer mentoring, cooperative challenges) to strengthen social connections.
