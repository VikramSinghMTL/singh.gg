## 1. Interpretation of Findings

This study examined the impact of a game-based learning intervention on the quality of peer feedback in a CS PCR setting and its influence on students' perceived competence, autonomy, and relatedness as conceptualized by SDT. The results indicate that while the intervention successfully improved feedback quality, its effects on psychological needs were mixed. These findings contribute to existing research on gamification in education [@indriasari2020a; @jayasinghe2013] and align with theories on motivation and learning engagement [@deci1994; @pintrich2003].

## 2. RQ1: Does a game-based learning intervention increase the quality of feedback provided during CS PCR?

The results provide strong evidence that the intervention led to a significant improvement in the quality of peer feedback. Both the paired t-test ($p = 0.0019$) and Wilcoxon signed-rank test ($p = 0.0017$) confirm that students provided higher-quality feedback post-intervention. This aligns with prior findings that gamification can enhance engagement and performance in educational settings (Indriasari et al., 2023; Llorens-Largo et al., 2016).

Qualitative responses reinforce these findings, with many students reporting that the game incentivized them to provide more detailed, constructive feedback. This supports Hattie & Timperley’s (2007) assertion that structured incentives can promote meaningful feedback behaviors. However, the fact that effort did not significantly increase ($p = 0.616$) suggests that students refined their approach rather than exerting more time or cognitive resources. This is consistent with research by Hamari et al. (2016), which found that gamification enhances efficiency without necessarily increasing workload.

Interestingly, while feedback quality improved, students' perception of its usefulness ($p = 0.136$) remained unchanged. This may indicate a disconnect between actual improvements and students’ awareness of their growth, a phenomenon observed in previous studies on peer assessment (Hamer et al., 2009). Future interventions could incorporate reflection exercises, allowing students to analyze their feedback over time and recognize their development (Chiang et al., 2011).

## 3. RQ2: Does the game-based learning intervention influence students' perceived competence, autonomy, and relatedness, as conceptualized by SDT?

The impact of the intervention on students' psychological needs, as outlined in SDT, presents a complex picture.

Competence: The intervention significantly increased students’ motivation to provide high-quality feedback ($p = 0.008$), reinforcing SDT’s argument that well-designed external motivators can enhance intrinsic motivation (Deci & Ryan, 1994). Students reported that the game encouraged them to be more strategic and thorough in their feedback, consistent with findings from prior gamification studies in CS education (Indriasari et al., 2021b; Goshevski et al., 2017). However, the lack of change in perceived feedback usefulness ($p = 0.522$) and confidence in feedback ($p = 0.309$) suggests that while students engaged more actively, they did not internalize these improvements as significant learning gains.

Autonomy: Contrary to expectations, students did not feel that the game increased their control over the feedback process ($p = 0.0036$). Rather than enhancing autonomy, some students felt constrained by the game’s structured mechanics or pressured by its competitive elements. This aligns with findings from Deci & Ryan (1994), who caution that any instructional strategy, when perceived as controlling, can diminish autonomy. It also resonates with research on peer assessment systems, where structured evaluation can sometimes limit perceived self-direction (Race, 2001). To address this, future implementations could incorporate more flexible mechanics, such as allowing students to choose how they engage with the game or modify scoring parameters based on their preferences (Al-Azawi et al., 2016).

Relatedness: The game did not significantly impact students' sense of peer connection ($p = 0.202$), suggesting that the competitive mechanics may not have fostered social cohesion. Prior research suggests that relatedness is more effectively cultivated through collaborative rather than competitive game elements (Deterding, 2011; Mohamed Masrop & Ishak, 2019). Integrating cooperative tasks, such as team-based feedback or shared objectives, could strengthen social bonds while preserving the motivational benefits of gamification.

## 4. Implications for Practice and Future Research

These findings provide practical insights for educators designing game-based learning interventions for peer feedback in CS education. First, while gamification effectively enhanced feedback quality, it did not necessarily lead to increased awareness of improvement. Embedding self-reflection mechanisms—such as peer discussion of feedback strategies or iterative review processes—could bridge this gap (Hundhausen et al., 2013). Second, fostering autonomy-supportive game mechanics is crucial. Allowing students more choice in their engagement strategy may prevent perceptions of constraint while maintaining motivational benefits (Li, 2006). Finally, enhancing social interaction within game-based learning should be a priority. Peer assessment in computing education often lacks direct collaboration (Petersen & Zingaro, 2018), so integrating cooperative game mechanics may enhance both relatedness and learning outcomes.

Future research should explore how different types of game-based interventions affect long-term learning outcomes in PCR. Additionally, comparative studies between competitive vs. cooperative gamification approaches could provide deeper insights into how game mechanics influence motivation, engagement, and feedback quality (Indriasari et al., 2020b).

## 5. Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, the research was conducted within a single CS course, limiting generalizability to other educational contexts. Second, while the intervention improved feedback quality, its long-term effects remain unknown. Future research should examine whether these improvements persist beyond the gamified environment. Additionally, reliance on self-reported survey measures introduces potential bias; incorporating objective measures of engagement and learning outcomes, such as analyzing changes in feedback content over multiple iterations, could strengthen the findings (Perez-Quinones & Turner, 2009).

## 6. Conclusion

This study demonstrates that a game-based learning intervention can significantly improve the quality of peer feedback in CS PCR while influencing motivation and engagement in complex ways. While students provided higher-quality feedback and reported increased motivation, they did not perceive increased autonomy or relatedness, highlighting the need for thoughtful game design. These findings contribute to the growing body of literature on gamification in education and suggest that carefully balancing motivational elements with autonomy and collaboration can optimize learning outcomes. Future research should continue refining game-based peer feedback systems to enhance their effectiveness in educational settings.
