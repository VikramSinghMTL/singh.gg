## 3.1 The Importance of PCR

PCR is a cornerstone of software development, both as a vital industry practice and as a valuable learning tool within CS education. By critically examining their peers' code, students hone their analytical skills, deepen their understanding of coding principles, and develop essential communication and collaboration abilities. However, the effectiveness of PCR hinges on student motivation. Research indicates that many CS students lack the intrinsic drive to provide meaningful and constructive feedback. This undermines the potential benefits of PCR for all participants. Motivational theories, particularly SDT, provide a lens for understanding the factors that influence student engagement with PCR. SDT posits that intrinsic motivation flourishes when individuals experience a sense of competence, autonomy, and relatedness. Applying SDT to the context of PCR can help identify specific aspects of the process that might either support or undermine student motivation, and subsequently, the quality of the feedback they provide. Emerging research suggests that gamification–the integration of game-like elements into non-game settings–can improve participation, motivation, and feedback quality in peer review. However, the potential of GBL, which centers on full-fledged games for educational aims, remains unexplored within this context. GBL prioritizes intrinsic motivation through immersive gameplay, potentially fostering the deep engagement necessary for providing thoughtful PCRs. This literature review examines the motivational challenges inherent in the PCR process and investigates the potential of GBL to address them. By synthesizing existing research on gamification, motivational theories, and the use of games in CS education, this review seeks to illuminate a significant research gap: the absence of studies specifically exploring GBL as a strategy to enhance student motivation and the quality of feedback provided during PCR within Computer Science education.

PCR plays a crucial role in CS education. By examining and providing feedback on their peers' code, students sharpen their understanding of coding standards, best practices, and software design principles [@cross1987; @indriasari2020a]. PCR not only reinforces technical skills but also fosters collaborative learning and critical thinking. Moreover, engaging in PCR helps students develop the ability to communicate effectively with their peers and learn from each other's mistakes [@indriasari2020a; @petersen2018]. In addition, PCR simulates real-world scenarios where software developers often work in teams and collaborate on projects. By honing their skills in giving and receiving constructive feedback, students prepare themselves for the professional environment they will enter upon graduation. This practice also contributes to a more thorough understanding of different programming languages, problem-solving techniques, and industry-specific tools and technologies [@indriasari2020a; @perez-quinones2009].

Engaging in PCR also helps students in developing their analytical skills and attention to detail, which are essential for identifying and fixing bugs and errors in code. Additionally, it encourages students to think critically about alternative solutions and approaches, thereby broadening their problem-solving capabilities [@li2006; @petersen2018]. PCR also serves as a valuable tool for self-improvement. By analyzing and evaluating their classmates' code, students can identify areas for personal growth and enhancement of their own coding practices. This process of critically assessing others' code compels students to reflect on their own solutions and consider alternative approaches [@hamer2009; @hundhausen2013]. Furthermore, PCR hopes to promote a culture of accountability and responsibility among students. The intention is that if individuals know that their work will be scrutinized by their peers, they will be motivated to produce high-quality and well-documented code. This looks to foster a sense of ownership and pride in their work, leading to a more professional approach to software development. PCR is integral to the development of not only technical expertise but also crucial soft skills that are essential for success in any technology-related career [@hamer2009; @indriasari2020a].

## 3.2 The Motivational Challenge

Motivating CS students to engage in quality PCR presents specific challenges. Studies reveal that student-generated peer reviews often lack depth and specificity, described as short and non-committal, failing to meet the expectations for useful feedback [@indriasari2020]. This indicates a need for strategies that enhance student engagement in the peer review process, ensuring that the feedback is not only frequent but also meaningful and constructive. Addressing these challenges is crucial for improving the learning outcomes in programming courses, where PCR is an essential component [@indriasari2021].

SDT is a motivational framework that emphasizes three core psychological needs: competence, autonomy, and relatedness. These needs play a crucial role in driving intrinsic motivation, leading to greater engagement and improved performance in learning contexts [@deci1994]. Competence refers to the need to feel effective in one's interactions with the environment. In the context of peer feedback in CS education, students are more likely to be motivated to provide constructive feedback when they feel competent in their ability to understand and evaluate their peers' code [@bandura2012; @indriasari2020]. Autonomy pertains to the need for individuals to feel a sense of choice and volition in their actions. When students have the autonomy to express their opinions and insights during PCR, it fosters a greater sense of ownership and motivation [@pintrich2003; @indriasari2021a]. Relatedness encompasses the desire to feel connected to others and experience a sense of belonging. In the context of peer feedback, creating a supportive and collaborative environment where students can engage in constructive discussions fosters a sense of relatedness, thereby enhancing their motivation to actively participate in the review process [@powell2009; @indriasari2023]. Understanding and addressing these core psychological needs outlined in SDT can significantly influence the effectiveness of peer feedback in CS education. By recognizing the importance of competence, autonomy, and relatedness, educators can implement strategies to foster a more engaging and motivating PCR environment for students.

## 3.3 Gamification vs. Game-Based Learning

Two learning approaches prevalent in the literature about increasing student motivation are gamification and GBL. These two approaches seek to increase student motivation by incorporating elements of games into instructional strategies. Simply put, gamification involves the use of game elements in non-game contexts, while GBL involves the use of actual games to deliver educational content. Therefore, while gamification relies on extrinsic motivators like rewards and recognition, GBL emphasizes intrinsic motivators such as enjoyment and engagement with the game and its educational content.

Gamification involves integrating game design elements, such as points, badges, and leaderboards, into non-game contexts to enhance engagement and motivation. It does not necessarily involve playing a game, but rather the use of game elements to make an activity more game-like and engaging [@jayasinghe2013]. In gamification, extrinsic motivation is often employed through the use of external rewards such as points, badges, or leaderboards to encourage desired behaviours or actions. This type of motivation comes from outside the individual and is not inherently related to the activity itself [@goshevski2017; @llorens-largo2016; @oktaviati2018]. Gamification has been shown to have a significant impact on student motivation and engagement in CS education. Research studies indicate that incorporating game elements into the learning process can enhance students' enthusiasm for the subject matter and increase their willingness to participate in activities such as PCR [@indriasari2023]. Integrating gamification into PCR can be achieved through various strategies. One effective approach is the use of gamified peer review platforms, where students can earn points, badges, or other rewards for providing high-quality and constructive feedback to their peers. Additionally, the incorporation of game elements such as challenges, levels, and collaborative problem-solving tasks can make the peer review process more engaging and enjoyable for CS students [@indriasari2021]. By integrating gamified learning strategies, educators can create an environment that promotes active involvement and extrinsic motivation among students, thus leading to an improved ability for compute science students' to PCR [@indriasari2020].

Conversely, GBL refers to using games to deliver specific educational content. This can include digital games, board games, or other types of games designed for educational purposes. GBL directly involves playing a game as part of the learning process [@al-azawi2016], and typically focuses on intrinsic motivation, which arises from the activity itself. In this approach, the engagement and enjoyment derived from playing the game are directly linked to the learning process. The challenge, curiosity, and enjoyment inherent in the game itself motivate the learners [@goshevski2017; @papastergiou2009]. GBL applications in CS education are diverse and designed to engage students in various aspects of the field. For instance, in CS, games are utilized to teach algorithms, data structures, networks, software testing, and programming languages [@schmitz2011; @videnovik2023]. This approach allows students to not only learn complex concepts in an interactive and fun way but also fosters critical thinking and collaboration skills. One of the key benefits is the bridging of the gap between theory and practice, enabling students to apply their knowledge in real-world contexts [@chiang2011; @jayasinghe2013]. Furthermore, leveraging storytelling and narrative elements within a game-based peer review structure can create a more immersive and incentivizing experience for the participants. This approach allows students to not only learn complex concepts in an interactive and fun way but also fosters critical thinking and collaboration skills [@al-azawi2016; @papastergiou2009]. The impact of GBL on student motivation and engagement in CS education is substantial. Studies have shown that incorporating GBL approaches not only increases students' motivation but also promotes active engagement in the learning process [@lopez-fernandez2021]. By leveraging the immersive and interactive nature of games, educators can create a more dynamic and stimulating learning environment for CS students [@videnovik2023].

## 3.4 The Potential of Game-Based Learning

A substantial body of research exists regarding the use of gamification within CS education [@mohamedmasrop2019]. This indicates that the integration of game-like elements such as points, badges, and leaderboards has been well explored in various CS learning contexts. However, there's a notable disparity when it comes to GBL, especially when focusing on its applications in the field of CS. This suggests a potential underutilization of full-fledged games in promoting CS learning objectives. While PCR offers undeniable benefits for developing essential coding, analytical, and communication skills, its success is contingent on student motivation. SDT provides a valuable framework for analyzing how elements of the PCR process could impact students' feelings of competence, autonomy, and relatedness, ultimately influencing their engagement and the quality of the feedback they provide. Existing research demonstrates the potential of gamification to enhance aspects of peer review, but its reliance on extrinsic motivators may have limitations for fostering the sustained intrinsic motivation required for giving comprehensive feedback. GBL, with its emphasis on enjoyment, immersion, and challenge, offers a promising yet under-investigated approach to addressing the motivational challenges within CS PCR. The literature reveals that gamification has been investigated within the realm of PCR to enhance the feedback process. This shows a greater emphasis on gamified approaches compared to utilizing games with deeper narratives and mechanics for peer assessment purposes. Whereas the intersection of gamification and PCR appears to be a small area of focus, the intersection of GBL and PCR is smaller still, if non-existent. The lack of studies investigated the potential of GBL for improving PCR within CS education represents a significant gap in the current research landscape. This leaves room for further exploration of how GBL could be designed effectively within the unique context of PCR.

This review, while by no means exhaustive, seeks to highlight a significant research gap: the absence of studies specifically examining the use of GBL to improve student motivation and feedback quality within CS PCR. This research project aims to address this gap by exploring if the application of GBL would have a direct impact on the quality of feedback given during PCR. Research in this area has the potential to significantly improve the overall effectiveness of PCR as a learning tool within CS education, ultimately better preparing students for success in their future professional careers.
