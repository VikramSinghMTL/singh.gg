## 3.1 The Importance of PCR

Peer code review (PCR) is one of the best ways for students to learn programming beyond simply writing their own code. It teaches them how to analyze and critique someone else’s work, which, in turn, makes them better at spotting mistakes in their own. This process is common in professional software development, where developers review and critique each other’s code regularly [@cross1987; @indriasari2020a]. In the classroom, PCR helps students understand coding standards, best practices, and software design principles. But it’s not only about technical skills. Students also practice communicating their ideas, justifying their decisions, and learning from different approaches to the same problem [@indriasari2020a; @petersen2018].

There’s a lot to gain from seeing how someone else thinks through a problem. Students might realize that there’s a simpler way to solve something or that they have been making the same mistake without noticing. Reviewing peer code pushes them to ask, "Why did they do it this way?" and "Would my approach be better?" This kind of critical thinking strengthens problem-solving skills and helps them adapt to new programming concepts [@indriasari2020a; @perez-quinones2009]. It also helps them recognize patterns such as common errors, smart solutions, and efficient techniques they might not have encountered otherwise [@li2006; @petersen2018].

PCR also builds self-awareness, helping students reflect on their own coding habits as they critique their peers’ work. Seeing mistakes or alternative approaches in someone else’s code can prompt students to ask whether they are making similar errors or if they could structure their own code more effectively [@brown2020]. This reflective process reinforces their understanding of key programming concepts, as articulating feedback requires them to evaluate and explain their reasoning clearly [@hamer2009; @hundhausen2013]. Additionally, knowing that their own work will be reviewed by peers makes students more deliberate in their coding decisions, leading to clearer, better-documented programs. Over time, this process fosters accountability and a sense of ownership over their work, preparing them for the expectations of professional software development [@hamer2009; @indriasari2020a].

## 3.2 The Motivational Challenge

Encouraging CS students to engage meaningfully in PCR presents a challenge. Research indicates that peer reviews often lack depth and specificity, with students providing feedback that is brief, uncritical, or superficial—falling short of instructor expectations [@indriasari2020a; @indriasari2021a]. Many students see peer review as a routine task rather than an opportunity for learning, which limits its potential benefits. While gamification has been shown to increase participation, studies suggest it does not necessarily improve the depth or usefulness of feedback [@khandelwal2017]. This underscores the need for strategies that not only encourage participation but also ensure that students provide thoughtful, constructive feedback. In programming courses, where well-executed peer feedback can significantly enhance learning, motivating students to engage deeply in PCR is especially important.

Self-Determination Theory (SDT) offers insight into why students may struggle to engage fully in PCR. According to SDT, intrinsic motivation is strongest when three core psychological needs are met: **competence**, **autonomy**, and **relatedness** [@deci1994]. When students feel capable, in control of their learning, and connected to their peers, they are more likely to find PCR valuable and invest effort willingly. Applying SDT to peer review can help identify ways to foster intrinsic motivation, ensuring that students engage not just for external incentives but because they see meaning in the process itself.

**Competence** refers to the need to feel capable and effective in a task. In PCR, students are more likely to provide meaningful feedback when they feel confident in their ability to understand and evaluate code [@bandura2012]. Those who doubt their programming or review skills may hesitate to offer substantive feedback, leading to shallow assessments. Conversely, students who develop confidence in analyzing code and identifying issues tend to engage more deeply in the review process. Strengthening this sense of competence can be achieved through training, structured review exercises, and guided practice. Research suggests that when students feel prepared and knowledgeable, they are more willing to participate in PCR and contribute meaningfully [@indriasari2020a].

**Autonomy** is the need to have control and choice in one's actions. In educational settings, students are more intrinsically motivated when they have some say in how they engage with a task. In PCR, autonomy can be supported by allowing students to choose whose code they review or providing flexibility in how they structure their feedback. When students feel trusted to make decisions in the peer review process, they develop a stronger sense of ownership and responsibility [@pintrich2003]. Even small choices, such as selecting which aspects of the code to focus on (style, correctness, efficiency, etc.), can enhance motivation. Prior research indicates that when learners perceive autonomy in academic tasks, their engagement increases [@indriasari2021a].

**Relatedness** refers to the need to feel connected to others and part of a learning community. PCR fosters relatedness through its collaborative nature, as students engage in reviewing each other’s work, often leading to discussions and shared learning experiences. When the classroom environment promotes trust and cooperation, students are more likely to see peer review as a meaningful, collective effort rather than an isolated requirement. This sense of connection can strengthen motivation, as students recognize that their feedback has value and that they, in turn, benefit from their peers' insights [@powell2009]. A supportive peer review culture, where students feel respected and comfortable giving and receiving feedback, may reinforce relatedness. In contrast, if PCR is conducted in an impersonal or competitive atmosphere, students may disengage to avoid criticism [@indriasari2023].

Addressing these three psychological needs, **competence, autonomy, and relatedness**, could be key to overcoming motivational barriers in PCR. In practice, this means equipping students with the skills and tools to feel **competent** in reviewing code through workshops, clear rubrics, and structured practice, supporting **autonomy** by allowing flexibility in the review process, and fostering **relatedness** through peer discussions and a collaborative classroom culture. When students feel capable, self-directed, and connected, they are more likely to engage deeply in peer review, producing thoughtful feedback and gaining more from the process [@brown2020]. This SDT perspective frames the exploration of game-based approaches as a potential strategy for improving motivation in PCR.

## 3.3 Gamification vs. Game-Based Learning

Two pedagogical approaches have gained attention for enhancing student motivation through game elements: **gamification** and **game-based learning (GBL)**. While both incorporate game concepts into education, they do so in distinct ways. **Gamification** adds game-like features to a non-game activity, whereas **GBL** turns the learning process into a game itself [@jayasinghe2013; @al-azawi2016]. In the context of PCR, gamification might involve awarding points or badges for completed reviews, while GBL could transform peer review into an interactive game experience.

In education, gamification typically involves introducing elements such as points, badges, leaderboards, levels, or timed challenges to make coursework more engaging. The key distinction is that students are not playing a game related to the subject matter; instead, traditional learning tasks like quizzes, assignments, or peer reviews are layered with an external reward system inspired by games [@jayasinghe2013]. This approach primarily drives **extrinsic motivation**, where students are encouraged to participate in order to earn rewards or avoid penalties rather than out of genuine interest in the task. For example, students may be more inclined to complete peer reviews if doing so earns them points or a higher leaderboard ranking. While gamified peer review systems can lead to an increase in the number of reviews and bug identifications, the quality of comments may not significantly improve, suggesting that extrinsic rewards alone are insufficient for fostering meaningful engagement [@khandelwal2017].

Studies suggest that gamification can positively influence student motivation and participation. In higher education, integrating points and badges into learning activities has been linked to increased student engagement and time spent on tasks [@goshevski2017; @llorens-largo2016; @oktaviati2018]. In CS education specifically, gamification has been associated with higher enthusiasm and persistence. For example, when game elements were added to a peer review system in a programming course, students showed greater willingness to participate in PCR than in a non-gamified setting [@indriasari2023].

Gamifying PCR can take various forms. One approach is to use a dedicated platform that tracks and rewards peer review contributions. Students might earn points for each piece of feedback they provide, unlock badges for reviewing a certain number of peers or identifying critical issues, and see their progress on a class leaderboard [@khandelwal2017]. These systems introduce elements of competition and achievement, making the peer review process more engaging. Researchers have tested these ideas, demonstrating that incorporating challenges and progression levels into PCR increased both the quantity and certain aspects of the quality of student feedback [@indriasari2021a].

While gamification effectively encourages participation, it primarily relies on extrinsic motivation—rewarding specific behaviours to drive engagement. This approach has clear short-term benefits, as students tend to respond positively to rewards and competitive elements. However, a key limitation is that motivation may decline once the rewards are removed or if the novelty fades. This raises the question of whether gamification should be supplemented with or balanced by strategies that foster deeper, intrinsic motivation.

GBL takes a different approach by making a _game_ the central medium for learning. In GBL, students engage with an educational game specifically designed to teach or reinforce key concepts and skills [@al-azawi2016]. Instead of earning points for completing a conventional task, their learning is embedded within a game narrative or challenge. This shifts the motivation from external rewards to the inherent enjoyment, curiosity, and challenge of the game itself, aligning closely with **intrinsic motivation**. A well-designed educational game keeps students engaged because they want to play, and in the process, they naturally develop the target skills. In PCR, a GBL approach might involve a scenario-based game where students take on roles like "code detective" or "software team leader" and must conduct peer reviews to advance in the story or solve a puzzle. Students who engage with a structured, game-based approach to PCR have been shown to increase knowledge retention and confidence in performing code reviews [@ardic2021]. Here, code review is not a separate assignment but an integral part of an engaging game experience.

Game-based learning has been successfully applied in various areas of computer science education. Educators have developed games to teach programming concepts, algorithms, data structures, and software engineering principles [@schmitz2011; @videnovik2023]. These range from simple quiz-based games to complex simulations and narrative-driven challenges. By interacting with these games, students can explore complex topics in a low-pressure environment. For instance, a game might allow students to visually manipulate algorithms or debug a program in a playful setting, making abstract concepts more concrete. Playing educational games also fosters **critical thinking and problem-solving**, as students must apply their knowledge to navigate in-game challenges. Additionally, **collaboration** is often a key element, particularly in multiplayer coding games where students review each other’s code to progress together. This naturally integrates PCR into the gameplay, reinforcing learning through interactive peer engagement. Because GBL packages learning as an enjoyable challenge, students may be more motivated to tackle difficult topics [@papastergiou2009; @goshevski2017].

One major strength of GBL is its ability to bridge theory and practice. Games often simulate real-world scenarios, requiring students to apply theoretical knowledge to achieve success [@chiang2011; @jayasinghe2013]. This makes abstract concepts more tangible and relevant. For example, a game designed to teach secure coding might challenge players to fix vulnerabilities in a series of programs to prevent a simulated cyberattack. In this context, students are not just learning about security concepts but actively applying them in a way that mirrors real-world challenges. Additionally, GBL can leverage storytelling and narrative elements to create immersive learning experiences. A mundane task can be transformed into an engaging adventure, such as a peer review mission where students help a team of stranded programmers debug their code. This type of narrative framing gives purpose to the PCR process within the game world, making it more compelling. When students become invested in the game’s outcome, they are also more engaged in the learning activities required to progress. Unlike gamification, where motivation is often tied to external rewards, GBL fosters **deep engagement** by making learning an enjoyable and immersive experience [@al-azawi2016; @papastergiou2009].

Research increasingly supports GBL as an effective tool for student engagement. Studies have shown that students learning through games often perform better than those in traditional settings, not necessarily due to differences in content but because game-based environments lead to greater engagement and time-on-task [@lopez-fernandez2021]. Students frequently describe educational games as more enjoyable and can enter a state of **flow**, where they are fully absorbed in problem-solving and learning. The interactive nature of games, which provides immediate feedback, helps sustain this engagement by allowing students to see the results of their decisions in real time. Additionally, the social dynamics of many games, whether competitive or cooperative, further enhance motivation. Students may compete against one another or collaborate to achieve a shared goal, reinforcing a sense of **relatedness** that supports deeper learning. Overall, GBL creates an adaptive, dynamic learning environment that provides instant rewards in the form of progress, keeps students engaged through entertainment value, and sustains motivation over time [@videnovik2023]. These qualities make GBL a promising approach for addressing challenges in peer code review.

## 3.4 The Potential of Game-Based Learning

Computer science education has seen extensive research on gamification, but far less focus on full game-based learning approaches. Studies have examined the impact of game-like elements such as points, badges, and leaderboards on student engagement, with findings suggesting that gamification can lead to short-term increases in participation and modest improvements in learning outcomes when applied effectively [@mohamedmasrop2019]. The literature reveals that while gamification of PCR has been attempted (albeit in only a handful of studies), using an actual game for PCR has received little attention. Ardıç [-@ardic2021] is one of the few studies to explore a game-based approach to teaching code review, though their focus was primarily on introducing students to the process rather than investigating its impact on peer feedback quality.

Peer code review has the potential to be more effective if student motivation can be improved. While the practice itself provides clear benefits for skill development, its success in an educational setting depends on students’ willingness to engage actively. Self-Determination Theory suggests that structuring PCR to support students' feelings of competence, autonomy, and relatedness should foster intrinsic motivation and lead to better outcomes. Traditional methods for increasing PCR participation, such as grading participation or relying on peer pressure, focus on extrinsic motivators and have limited long-term impact.

Gamification has been explored as a way to enhance engagement in PCR. Studies show that adding game elements can increase participation and introduce a level of competition that keeps students involved [@indriasari2020a; @indriasari2023]. However, gamification primarily drives **extrinsic motivation**, where students may focus on earning points or climbing leaderboards rather than developing high-quality feedback skills. Research has shown that while gamification can lead to more reviews being completed, it does not always improve the depth or usefulness of those reviews [@khandelwal2017]. This raises concerns about whether gamification alone is sufficient for fostering meaningful engagement in PCR or if a more immersive, intrinsically motivating approach like GBL may be necessary.

A GBL approach to PCR could naturally promote deeper engagement by making the peer review process enjoyable in its own right. Unlike gamification, where motivation often stems from external rewards, GBL fosters **intrinsic motivation** by emphasizing enjoyment, immersion, and challenge. When students are absorbed in a game-based peer review activity, their engagement comes from the experience itself rather than a desire to earn points or climb a leaderboard. This raises the question of whether GBL might be more effective than gamification in cultivating the type of motivation that leads to high-quality feedback.

If students find a code review game genuinely engaging or intellectually stimulating, they are likely to focus on overcoming challenges—such as analyzing and critiquing code—because they want to progress in the game. This could turn PCR from a routine task into a compelling activity, naturally encouraging more thoughtful and thorough feedback. Research suggests that motivation is strongest when students see a task as something they _want_ to do rather than something they _have_ to do for a reward [@khandelwal2017]. This perspective drives the exploration of GBL for PCR: a well-designed educational game may sustain motivation more effectively than a gamified system and lead to higher-quality engagement in peer review.

Despite its strong theoretical potential, the combination of GBL and PCR remains largely unexplored in existing research. Most studies on enhancing peer code review through game elements have focused on gamification, such as adding points and badges or comparing sections with and without gamified incentives. These studies suggest that gamification can be an effective engagement tool, but they also leave open the possibility that a more immersive approach could yield better results. While gamification of PCR has been examined in a limited number of studies, there is no documented research on using a full **game-based learning** approach for peer code review.

This presents a **significant gap** in the literature. Although GBL has been shown to improve motivation and learning outcomes in other educational contexts, its impact on PCR has yet to be studied. Given that peer review requires sustained engagement and critical thinking, it stands to reason that an intrinsically motivating approach like GBL could enhance the process. Without empirical research in this area, educators are missing evidence on a potentially transformative method for improving student participation and feedback quality in peer code review.

Recognizing this gap, the present literature review highlights the need for research that applies GBL to PCR in CS education. If future studies demonstrate that embedding peer review within a game environment leads to increased engagement and higher-quality feedback, it could open new possibilities for enhancing learning in programming courses. Such findings could support the development of specialized educational games or platforms that merge the pedagogical benefits of PCR with the motivational impact of games.

Exploring GBL in PCR aligns with the broader goal of fostering **intrinsic motivation** in learners. If GBL proves to be more effective than traditional methods or simple gamification, it could significantly enhance the effectiveness of PCR as a learning tool. This study aims to address this gap by investigating whether a game-based learning strategy can improve both student motivation and the quality of peer feedback in a CS course. By doing so, we seek to contribute empirical evidence on whether GBL provides a meaningful advantage over gamification in engaging students in high-quality peer code review.
