The purpose of this literature review is to examine how peer assessment, motivation, and Game-Based Learning (GBL) intersect in the context of Computer Science (CS) education, with a focus on improving the quality of Peer Code Review (PCR). While peer feedback has long been recognized as a valuable learning strategy, its effectiveness depends on students' willingness to participate meaningfully, a challenge that becomes especially pronounced in technical disciplines like programming. This chapter begins by grounding the discussion in general educational theory on peer assessment before narrowing the focus to PCR in CS. It then explores the motivational challenges that often undermine the effectiveness of PCR, reviews the benefits and limitations of gamification, and proposes GBL as an alternative approach through the lens of Self-Determination Theory (SDT). The chapter concludes by identifying the gap in the literature this study seeks to address.

## Peer Assessment in Education

Peer assessment is a well-established instructional strategy that can enhance learning by engaging students in the process of evaluating the work of others. Unlike traditional instructor-led feedback, peer feedback encourages learners to become active participants in assessment, helping them develop evaluative judgment and a deeper understanding of quality standards [@topping2017; @falchikov2013a]. When students assess each other's work, they practice articulating their reasoning by comparing different approaches and making informed judgments. These activities promote critical thinking and self-regulated learning [@ladyshewsky2012]. This process also exposes students to diverse perspectives and ideas, contributing to a broader conceptual understanding of the subject matter.

Peer assessment aligns with social constructivist learning theories, which emphasize the importance of interaction in knowledge construction. According to the concept of the _Zone of Proximal Development_ (ZPD), learners progress most effectively when supported just beyond their current capabilities by more knowledgeable others [@vygotsky1978a]. In peer feedback settings, this support comes not from a teacher but from classmates working at a similar level. By reviewing and discussing each other's work, students gain access to alternative problem-solving strategies and language they might not have generated independently. This process can help springboard learners into new heights of competence, especially when peer interactions are structured to promote thoughtful critique and reflection [@falchikov2013a; @vygotsky1978a].

The act of giving feedback is especially beneficial for the reviewer. Research shows that providing feedback can enhance the reviewer's own learning as much, if not more, than receiving it [@huisman2018; @lundstrom2009]. Reviewing work requires students to apply their knowledge in context, identify strengths and weaknesses, and communicate suggestions clearly, all of which reinforce their grasp of core concepts. Peer assessment has also been linked to improved metacognition, accountability, and communication skills, as students must consider how their input may be received and used by others [@ndoye2017]. When implemented thoughtfully, peer feedback not only improves academic outcomes but also cultivates lifelong learning skills that extend beyond the classroom.

## The Importance of Peer Code Review

Peer feedback in the CS classroom takes form via the process of PCR, which offers an effective way for students to learn programming beyond simply writing their own code. It teaches them how to analyze and critique someone else's work, which, in turn, makes them better at spotting mistakes in their own. This process is common in professional software development, where developers review and critique each other's code regularly [@cross1987; @indriasari2020a]. In the classroom, PCR helps students understand coding standards, best practices, and software design principles. However, it's not only about technical skills. Students also practice communicating their ideas, justifying their decisions, and learning from different approaches to the same problem [@indriasari2020a; @petersen2018].

As with other forms of peer assessment, the value of PCR lies not only in the feedback students receive but in the cognitive effort involved in giving feedback. Reviewing code requires students to step back from their own habits and think critically about design, efficiency, and readability. This evaluative process activates higher-order thinking and supports metacognitive development, helping students become more aware of their own strengths and weaknesses as programmers [@brown2020; @hundhausen2013; @li2006; @sripada2015]. It also resonates with the pedagogical theory of the ZPD: when students encounter code written differently by peers, it can prompt them to adopt new strategies just beyond their current level of competence [@vygotsky1978a]. Rather than a one-way transfer of expertise, this peer interaction creates a shared space where learning is socially constructed and iteratively developed.

Furthermore, PCR fosters accountability and communication. The awareness that their code will be reviewed encourages students to write with greater care, making more deliberate and documented choices [@hamer2009; @indriasari2020a]. Giving and receiving feedback also builds soft skills that are essential in software development, including the ability to explain decisions, respond to critique, and collaborate respectfully. In this way, PCR mirrors real-world practices while reinforcing the kinds of reflective, communicative habits that deepen both individual learning and collective understanding [@li2006]. While the pedagogical value of PCR is clear, its success depends on students' willingness to participate fully, making motivation a critical area of inquiry.

## The Motivational Challenge

Encouraging CS students to participate meaningfully in PCR presents a challenge. Research indicates that peer reviews often lack depth and specificity, with students providing feedback that is brief, uncritical, or superficial, falling short of instructor expectations [@indriasari2020a; @indriasari2021a]. Many students see peer review as a routine task rather than an opportunity for learning, which limits its potential benefits. This underscores the need for strategies that not only encourage participation but also ensure that students provide thoughtful, constructive feedback. In programming courses, motivating students to immerse deeply in PCR is especially important, as well-executed peer feedback not only enhances learning but also contributes to more robust and maintainable software.

A foundational motivation theory in psychology, SDT offers insight into why students may struggle to fully tackle PCR. According to SDT, intrinsic motivation is strongest when three core psychological needs are met: competence, autonomy, and relatedness [@deci1985; @deci1994]. Importantly, several studies [@ryan2000; @gagne2005; @vandenbroeck2021; @covington2000] show that intrinsic motivation, doing something for the inherent satisfaction it provides, leads to better outcomes than extrinsic motivation, which is driven by external rewards. When students feel capable, in control of their learning, and connected to their peers, they are more likely to find PCR meaningful and invest effort willingly. Applying SDT to PCR can help identify ways to promote intrinsic motivation, ensuring that students partake not just for external incentives but because they value the process itself.

_Competence_ refers to the need to feel capable and effective in a task. In PCR, students are more likely to provide meaningful feedback when they feel confident in their ability to understand and evaluate code [@bandura2012]. Those who doubt their programming or review skills may hesitate to offer substantive feedback, leading to shallow assessments [@petersen2018]. Conversely, students who develop confidence in identifying areas for improvement tend to analyze code more deeply in the review process [@hundhausen2013]. Strengthening this sense of competence can be achieved through training, structured review exercises, and guided practice. Research suggests that when students feel prepared and knowledgeable, they are more willing to participate in PCR and contribute meaningfully [@indriasari2020a].

_Autonomy_ is the need to have control and choice in one's actions. In educational settings, students are more intrinsically motivated when they have some say in how they complete a task [@ryan2000]. When students feel trusted to make decisions in the peer review process, they develop a stronger sense of ownership and responsibility [@pintrich2003]. Prior research indicates that when learners feel autonomous in academic tasks, their motivation increases [@indriasari2021a]. In PCR, autonomy can be supported by allowing students to choose which sections of code they review (style, correctness, efficiency, etc.) or providing flexibility in how they structure their feedback.

_Relatedness_ refers to the need to feel connected to others and part of a learning community. PCR fosters relatedness through its collaborative process as students review each other's work, often leading to discussions and shared learning experiences [@falchikov2013a]. A supportive peer review culture, in which students feel respected and comfortable giving and receiving feedback, may reinforce relatedness. In contrast, if PCR is conducted in an impersonal or competitive atmosphere, students may become unmotivated in order to avoid criticism [@indriasari2023]. When the classroom environment promotes trust and cooperation, students are more likely to see PCR as a meaningful, collective effort rather than an isolated requirement [@falchikov2013a]. This sense of connection can strengthen motivation, as students recognize that their feedback has value and that they, in turn, benefit from their peers' insights [@powell2009].

Addressing these three psychological needs (competence, autonomy, and relatedness) could be key to overcoming motivational barriers in PCR. In practice, this means equipping students with the skills and tools to feel competent in reviewing code through scaffolded practice and clear rubrics, supporting autonomy by allowing flexibility in the review process, and fostering relatedness through peer discussions and a collaborative classroom culture. When students feel capable, self-directed, and connected, they are more likely to produce thoughtful feedback and gain more from the process [@brown2020]. While SDT provides a useful lens for understanding student motivation, further work is needed to explore instructional strategies that operationalize these principles within authentic learning environments like PCR.

## Gamification: Benefits and Limitations

Gamification is a pedagogical approach that has gained attention for enhancing student motivation by incorporating reward systems from games, such as badges, levels, achievements, and points, into educational contexts [@deterding2011; @nicholson2015]. As defined by Deterding [-@deterding2011], gamification is "the use of game design elements in non-game contexts" [p. 19]. Studies suggest that gamification can positively influence motivation in higher education by increasing engagement through gamified learning activities in the classroom [@goshevski2017; @llorens-largo2016; @oktaviati2018]. In CS education specifically, gamification has been associated with greater enthusiasm and persistence [@narasareddygari2018]. For example, when game elements were added to a peer review system in a programming course, students showed increased willingness to participate in PCR compared to a non-gamified setting [@indriasari2023].

Gamifying PCR can take various forms. One approach is to use a dedicated platform that tracks and rewards peer review contributions. Students might earn points for each comment they write, unlock badges for providing feedback to a certain number of peers or identifying critical issues, and see their progress on a class leaderboard [@khandelwal2017]. These systems introduce elements of competition and achievement, making the peer review process more engaging. Researchers have tested these ideas, demonstrating that incorporating challenges and progression levels into PCR increased both the quantity and certain aspects of the quality of student feedback [@indriasari2021a].

While gamification has been shown to be most effective when it satisfies SDT's psychological needs [@kam2018], it primarily relies on extrinsic motivation, when students are encouraged to participate to earn rewards or avoid penalties rather than out of genuine interest in the task. For example, students may be more inclined to complete peer reviews if doing so earns them points or a higher leaderboard ranking. While gamification can increase participation, it does not always lead to higher-quality peer feedback [@khandelwal2017]. A key limitation of gamification is that motivation often declines once rewards are removed or the novelty fades [@papastergiou2009]. This pattern is consistent with the _overjustification effect_, which posits that external rewards can reduce intrinsic motivation in a task over time [@deci1971; @lepper1973]. This raises the question of whether a more immersive, intrinsically motivating approach could be more effective.

## Game-Based Learning as an Alternative Approach

Unlike gamification, Game-Based Learning (GBL) is a fundamentally different instructional paradigm that embeds learning directly into the game experience. As defined by Pinedo et al. [-@pinedo2022], "Game-based learning (GBL) refers to the use of games to support learning in educational settings or as educational tools" [p. 1603]. Rather than layering external rewards onto traditional learning tasks, GBL integrates educational content within game narratives, challenges, and mechanics [@jayasinghe2013]. This shift encourages intrinsic motivation by making the learning process itself enjoyable, curiosity-driven, and meaningful.

A useful lens for understanding this structural integration is the concept of _meaningful play_, which is defined as the relationship between player actions and system outcomes [@salen2003]. For play to be meaningful, this relationship must be both _discernable_, meaning that players can perceive how their actions affect the game, and _integrated_, such that those effects must influence future gameplay in a coherent way. In educational contexts, meaningful play reinforces learning by requiring students to think, act, and adapt within a responsive environment, which encourages higher levels of motivation. This structural integration ensures that PCR is not an add-on but an essential part of the game system itself. By this definition, a game-based approach to PCR would need to ensure that the quality of students' feedback has visible consequences and shapes future gameplay.

Building on this motivational foundation, GBL is particularly well-suited to address challenges in PCR by embedding the activity within meaningful, story-driven scenarios that simulate real-world software development. Rather than treating PCR as a separate assignment, students might take on roles like "code detective" or "scrum master," engaging in tasks such as debugging systems to rescue stranded developers or securing vulnerable code under time pressure [@chiang2011; @jayasinghe2013]. These immersive scenarios not only reinforce technical skills but also connect abstract concepts to authentic contexts, enhancing perceived relevance. Narrative framing further amplifies this effect by giving students a sense of purpose and emotional investment, which in turn increases attention, effort, and information retention [@ardic2021; @paxinos2024].

GBL has already proven effective across multiple domains of CS education, providing a strong precedent for its use in PCR. Educators have developed games to teach programming, algorithms, data structures, and software engineering principles [@schmitz2011; @shabanah2010; @videnovik2023]. These range from simple quiz-based platforms to complex simulations and narrative-driven experiences. Through gameplay, students can explore abstract and difficult topics in a lower-stakes setting. For example, a debugging game may challenge students to identify and fix errors in code, reinforcing both syntax and logic skills in an interactive way. This alignment between game tasks and learning objectives makes GBL a versatile tool in CS education.

In addition to honing discipline-specific cognitive skills, GBL environments also support social learning through peer interaction, which strengthens the collaborative aspects of PCR. Many educational games incorporate cooperative or competitive elements that require students to make decisions together to succeed [@videnovik2023]. This structure encourages meaningful dialogue, shared problem-solving, and peer feedback, which are core components of effective PCR [@brown2020]. The enjoyment of shared gameplay also contributes to students' willingness to persist through complex tasks, making difficult concepts feel more approachable [@papastergiou2009; @goshevski2017].

Because these immersive experiences make learning personally meaningful, students often report higher levels of enjoyment. They may even enter a state of flow [@csikszentmihalyi1990] while playing educational games, resulting in deeper immersion in the learning activity [@papastergiou2009]. In particular, GBL has been directly linked to the satisfaction of the three basic psychological needs outlined in SDT. Game environments promote autonomy by giving players meaningful choices, agency over strategy, and freedom to explore alternate paths [@ryan2006; @uysal2016]. Competence is supported through well-calibrated challenges, adaptive difficulty, and instant feedback loops that allow learners to understand the consequences of their actions and feel a sense of progression [@habgood2011; @perez2022; @ryan2006; @salen2003]. Relatedness can be fostered in multiplayer or collaborative contexts, when players share goals, exchange support, and build social bonds [@ryan2006; @videnovik2023]. These psychological needs map naturally onto the mechanisms that support intrinsic motivation and deeper motivation in learning [@proulx2017; @papastergiou2009]. GBL environments often outperform traditional instructional methods not because of different content, but due to the increased motivation and time-on-task they promote [@lopez-fernandez2021]. By aligning game design elements with the core tenets of SDT, educators can create experiences that not only enhance motivation but also support skill development in complex learning tasks such as PCR.

## The Literature Gap

Although PCR and GBL have each been studied extensively, their intersection remains largely unmapped. Most existing work on motivating PCR focuses on gamification to drive participation [@indriasari2020a; @khandelwal2017; @narasareddygari2018]. While these strategies can provide a boost, they rely on extrinsic motivators and may not lead to deeper learning or lasting motivation. Research on GBL shows that immersive, action-driven experiences can improve autonomy, competence, and relatedness [@ryan2006; @uysal2016; @videnovik2023], yet few studies have examined how these benefits might extend specifically to PCR.

This study addresses that gap by investigating whether embedding PCR within a GBL environment can enhance both student motivation and the quality of peer feedback in a CS context. Grounded in SDT, the study explores whether the structural integration of PCR into a custom-designed game system can provide a more intrinsically motivating and pedagogically effective alternative to conventional PCR approaches. By ensuring that students' feedback influences future gameplay, the intervention operationalizes key principles of meaningful play, where learning activities are embedded within the game's logic and progression. In doing so, the study contributes empirical insight into how game-based designs might better align with how students reflect and learn in CS courses.
