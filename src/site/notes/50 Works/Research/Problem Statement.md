A fundamental part of professional software development [@li2006], Peer Code Review (PCR) involves developers evaluating each other's code based on style guides and best practices. These reviews often focus on aspects such as naming conventions, function scope, spacing, and documentation, and typically lead to a back-and-forth dialogue aimed at improving code quality. PCR is widely adopted in the industry as a key quality assurance practice, and educational research suggests it can also support student learning by encouraging reflection, collaboration, and analytical thinking [@race2001; @powell2009].

Despite these pedagogical benefits, a common challenge in CS education is that students are often unmotivated to provide high-quality peer feedback [@indriasari2021a]. This lack of motivation can stem from time constraints, unclear incentives, or uncertainty about the value of the review process.

In terms of Self-Determination Theory (SDT) [@deci1985; @deci1994], low motivation in PCR can be understood as the result of unmet psychological needs. The first of these is _autonomy_, or the perception that one's actions are self-directed and meaningful. In many peer feedback contexts, students report feeling that they are completing the activity out of obligation rather than intrinsic interest [@pintrich2003; @indriasari2021a]. They may not see the purpose of peer feedback beyond grading requirements, and the task itself may lack personal relevance or choice, leading to surface-level participation [@ramsden2003]. Additionally, structural features of the CEGEP system, most notably the R-score, which compares students’ academic performance relative to their peers, can reinforce a sense of external pressure and competition. Some students report that this system diminishes their sense of control and shifts their focus away from personal learning toward outperforming classmates [@dagres2017]. These pressures may reduce intrinsic motivation by making success feel contingent on circumstances outside the student’s control.

The second need, _competence_, refers to feeling capable of succeeding in a task. Students may avoid giving detailed feedback because they feel unqualified to assess someone else's code, particularly when their peers are at different skill levels [@bandura2012; @perez-quinones2009]. This perceived lack of expertise can reduce confidence and lead to vague or minimal comments that fail to foster learning, neither for the reviewer nor the recipient [@indriasari2020; @petersen2018].

Finally, _relatedness_ reflects the need to feel socially connected and respected within a learning environment. In peer review situations, students may feel isolated, especially if feedback is anonymized or asynchronous. They might be reluctant to critique others' work for fear of damaging relationships or being judged themselves [@powell2009; @indriasari2023]. Without a sense of shared purpose or community, the peer review process can feel impersonal and transactional rather than collaborative.

While logistical and interpersonal challenges can also impact the effectiveness of PCR [@falchikov2013a; @indriasari2023], the motivational barriers described above, low autonomy, competence, and relatedness, remain particularly challenging in traditional peer review settings. Therefore, what has been unveiled is a need to explore alternative instructional strategies that can better support these psychological needs and improve efficacy within the feedback process.
