PCR is a fundamental part of being a professional software developer [@li2006 9]. This is a process that is done when a developer makes a change or add to the already existing codebase. One or more of their teammates will evaluate and make suggestions on the code based on an agreed upon style guide and general coding best practices. These suggestions include, but are not limited to, variable and function naming conventions, spacing, comments, size and scope of functions. The developer then has to implement the feedback from their peers, often creating a dialogue with the team that leads to uncovering more related issues with the codebase. This process is critical in the quality assurance of the application and is commonly enacted by most software companies. Despite this requirement, the research suggests that students lack motivation to give quality peer feedback during the code review process [@indriasari2021a]. To give quality peer feedback, students must be engaged in the process. The literature states that students learn better by doing than by passively listening [@powell2009] and that students can deepen their own learning through peer assessment [@race2001].

However, despite its numerous benefits, one of the challenges encountered in current PCR practices is the low motivation among CS students in providing quality peer feedback. This lack of motivation can hinder the effectiveness of the PCR process and prevent students from fully reaping the benefits of this collaborative learning experience [@petersen2018]. This can be due to various reasons such as time constraints, lack of incentive, or inadequate understanding of the value of constructive feedback. Additionally, students may feel uncomfortable critiquing their peers' work or may not have the necessary skills to provide meaningful and constructive feedback [@perez-quinones2009].

Another challenge is the potential for biases and conflicts to arise during PCR. Students may struggle to separate personal relationships from professional feedback, leading to tension within the peer group. Furthermore, differences in skill levels and experiences among students can also impact the effectiveness of the PCR process, as it may be difficult for students to provide feedback on code that is significantly more advanced or complex than their own [@indriasari2021].

Lastly, the logistics of organizing and managing PCR sessions can also pose challenges. Coordinating schedules, ensuring equal participation, and providing clear guidelines for the review process can be demanding for educators and may impact the overall quality of the review experience [@indriasari2023].

Addressing these challenges is crucial to enhancing the effectiveness of PCR and maximizing its benefits for CS students. Implementing strategies to motivate students, providing training on giving and receiving constructive feedback, and fostering an inclusive and supportive peer review environment are essential steps towards overcoming these obstacles.
