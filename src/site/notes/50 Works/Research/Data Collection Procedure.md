## Observations

- Giving catan
- Physical space is a problem, using laps as tables, maybe get a classroom?
- Laugh at procrastination, some of the flavour texts
- Quiet concentration for a couple of groups
- Need to learn the rules first, duh
- Smiles, camaraderie, jokes, very loud!
- symbol blue card in corner so you can see in your hand
- slowly incorporate yellows?
- force green discard over blues?
- Definitely increased motivation to know the the criteria of yellow distribution
- Diminishing returns on replayability? Future research on repeated play
- Leaderboard? Paul says most people won't win, which tends to lead to demotivation
- If you win x number of times, you unlock a special card?

## My Biases

- Mentioning that my students that I love get to be a part of my masters journey.
- Being in the room while they're filling out the survey.
- Telling them how the yellows are calculated (ask Paul about this one).
