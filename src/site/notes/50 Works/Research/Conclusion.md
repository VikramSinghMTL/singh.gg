This study examined whether a game-based learning (GBL) intervention could improve the quality of peer feedback and increase students' intrinsic motivation to participate in Peer Code Review (PCR) in a Computer Science (CS) course. By embedding feedback performance into the mechanics of a classroom card game, the intervention aligned with principles of meaningful play and Self-Determination Theory (SDT), aiming to support autonomy, competence, and relatedness. The findings contribute to ongoing efforts to enhance peer feedback in technical disciplines by demonstrating how thoughtfully designed GBL can increase student motivation in authentic learning tasks.

The results for the first research question show that students' feedback became significantly more specific and actionable after the GBL intervention. This improvement was reinforced by student reflections describing increased effort and attention during the review process. The structural integration of feedback performance into gameplay created a meaningful incentive that many students found motivating. These results suggest that linking peer feedback quality to game mechanics can serve as an effective strategy for increasing motivation and depth in PCR activities.

The intervention, with respect to the second research question, was associated with a statistically significant increase in students' perceived autonomy during peer review. This outcome indicates that the game design supported a greater sense of ownership and self-direction in how students approached the feedback process. However, no significant gains were observed in perceived competence or relatedness. These findings highlight the need for additional design elements, such as formative scaffolds and collaborative mechanics, to more fully support the psychological needs that underlie intrinsic motivation.

The conclusions are constrained by limitations in scope, including (but not limited to) the short intervention period, modest sample size, and the inability to conduct paired-sample analyses due to anonymous data collection. Nonetheless, the results offer a promising foundation for further investigation into how GBL can enhance student motivation and feedback practices in CS education. Future research should explore the sustainability of these effects over time, assess outcomes in more diverse populations, and examine hybrid approaches that combine individual competition with team-based collaboration.

When learning becomes part of the game, and the game reflects the quality of learning, students begin to care not just about playing well, but about thinking well. This study shows that when peer feedback is meaningfully embedded in gameplay, students respond with greater effort, agency, and intention. For educators seeking to move beyond surface participation in peer review, GBL offers more than fun gameplay, it offers instructional alignment. It connects motivation to mastery and turns feedback into a shared, dynamic experience. The classroom, like any good game, thrives on clear rules, meaningful choices, and a sense of purpose. When designed thoughtfully, it becomes a space where students play not just to win, but to grow.
