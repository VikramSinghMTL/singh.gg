## Topic

Improving computer science students' motivation to provide quality peer code review through game-based learning.

## Problem

- Peer code review is a fundamental part of being a professional software developer, yet many Computer Science students lack this key skill.
- Computer Science students are unmotivated to provide quality feedback in the peer code review process.

## Questions

1. Why are Computer Science students demotivated to give quality feedback?
2. How can Computer Science teachers apply a game-based learning approach to peer code review?
3. Does a game-based learning approach, designed to increase computer science students' motivation, increase the quality of the feedback provided during peer code review?

## Outline

When looking for articles, I focused search terms around:

1. Computer Science
2. Game-based learning
3. Gamification
4. Peer assessment
5. Motivation

## 1. Peer Code Review is a critical skill to learn for software developers

Engaging in peer code review helps students in develop their analytical skills and attention to detail, which are essential for identifying and fixing bugs and errors in code. This skill is a standard practice in the industry.

## 2. Motivation is a key factor for student engagement

Some key motivational theories relevant to education include Self-Determination Theory, Expectancy Theory, Social Development Theory, and Goal Setting Theory. The application of motivational theories to understand student motivation in peer feedback is pivotal in identifying effective strategies for engagement, and to potentially identify why students do not provide quality peer code reviews.

## 3. CS students lack of motivation is a challenge for for quality peer code review

Student-generated peer code reviews often lack depth and specificity. The feedback tends to be short, non-committal, and fails to be useful. Students are not intrinsically motivated to provide useful feedback. Addressing these challenges is crucial for improving the overall quality of peer code reviews.

## 4. Gamification and game-based learning can increase student motivation in peer code reviews

### 4.1 Definition and distinction between gamification and game-based learning

Gamification and game-based learning are two distinct approaches that incorporate elements of games. Gamification involves the use of game elements in non-game contexts, while game-based learning involves the use of games to deliver educational content.

### 4.2 Extrinsic motivation in gamification vs. intrinsic motivation in game-based learning

While gamification relies on extrinsic motivators like rewards and recognition, game-based learning emphasizes intrinsic motivators such as enjoyment and engagement with the game and its educational content.

### 4.3 Game-based learning is an effective instructional strategy in Computer Science education

In computer science, games have been utilized to teach algorithms, data structures, networks, software testing, and programming languages. Therefore, experimenting with game-based learning for peer code reviews seems like a logical next step.

### 4.4 Gamification has been shown to improve peer code review skills

While these authors have extensively studied gamification in the peer code review process, using a game-based approach has not been done yet. They conclude by saying more research in this field is required.

## 5. Identifying the Research Gap

From the articles I am currently able to find,

- There are **17** articles about using _gamification_ in _computer science_ education.
- There are **6** articles about using _game-based learning_ in _computer science_ education.
- There are **5** articles about using _gamification_ during the _peer assessment_ process.
- There are **3** articles about using _game-based learning_ during the _peer assessment_ process.
- There are **4** articles about using _gamification_ during the _peer assessment_ process in _computer science_ education.
- There are **** articles about _game-based learning_ during the _peer assessment_ process in _computer science_ education.

From the lack of studies based around game-based learning to increase motivation for the peer code review process, I am curious to find out if this method has the potential to bear fruit.
