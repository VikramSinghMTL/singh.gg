## Initial Notes (2024.08.28)

- what is the game via SDT
- could have a control, or have the same group play no game and then play the game
- keep the game simple
- add a layer to the moodle workshop activity
- create a currency or payment system
- starting money for monopoly game (gamified) and the money is earned from the peer review
- how to unlock thing or lootboxes?
- Narritive games, creating a simple game board game where the currency is earned by feedback
- Something that would move a piece, move the piece to the finish based on resources
    - car across you need wheels gas engine
        - engine need x things that are distributed
        - trading game? every coder has 10 cards, you can pull a card from the deck and its random. I have three wheels, I have to trade for an engine.
        - A trade card that gets burned when you trade. When you provide good feedback, you get a trade card.
    - two phases.
        - resource gathering phase is based on the feedback based on the code review taxonomy
        - Is the person that receives the feedback the judge?
        - Maybe an LLM could take in the CRT and it could reward the student based on the feedback
        - AI is a tool just like dice/cards/etc.
- Keep in mind we're still measuring the reliability of GPT and it's not essential to the outcome
- No game and then game, so don't keep sections separate to have. When doing no game, I still have to tell them that their is an experiment but I don't have to say specifically what I'm looking for. The consent form will cover both sessions, game and not game.
- Either they run their own prompt and generate their own cards, or they bring back the feedback
- OR they start the game before feedback, they get invested a little bit, we have no tires or an engine. Could be an existing card game.
    - Three phases, be very explicit about each step of the game and feedback process.
- Keep the game SIMPLE

## Game

- Resources (Blue)
    - Drawn every turn and can used to build structures.
- Structures (Orange)
    - A player can obtain these by spending resources.
    - Perhaps there are only a certain number of these based on the number of players.
    - These would have to be in a separate pile for players to buy.
    - Building the castle structure is the win condition and requires many resources.
- Events (Red)
    - If a player draws this, they must lose either 3 resources or 1 structure.
- Trade (Green)
    - A player may use this card to trade with another player to get a card they need. These will be given out based on the peer feedback quality.

Every turn a card is drawn. The player may spend resources to build structures while avoiding events. The structures grant additional resources per turn. First player to build a castle, they win!
