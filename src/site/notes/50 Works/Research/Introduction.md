Peer Code Review (PCR) is a fundamental practice in software development, enabling programmers to evaluate one another's work for quality, functionality, and adherence to best practices. In educational contexts, PCR has the potential to deepen learning by fostering reflection, collaboration, and critical thinking [@hamer2009; @hundhausen2013]. However, despite its pedagogical value, students often conduct PCR superficially, offering vague or minimal feedback that limits the effectiveness of the exercise [@indriasari2020; @petersen2018].

A key factor influencing the quality of peer feedback is student motivation. Many learners perceive peer review as a compliance task rather than an educational experience. To improve its impact, educators must consider the motivational dynamics that shape how students participate in feedback exchanges.

Self-Determination Theory (SDT) provides a robust framework for understanding intrinsic motivation in educational settings [@deci1985; @deci1994]. According to SDT, students are more likely to participate meaningfully when three basic psychological needs are met: competence (feeling effective), autonomy (experiencing volition), and relatedness (feeling socially connected). Yet in many peer review settings, these needs are unmet. Students may lack confidence in their evaluative abilities, feel constrained by rigid instructions, or experience limited connection with their peers.

To address these limitations, this study investigates the use of Game-Based Learning (GBL) to enhance motivation and feedback quality in PCR. Distinct from gamification, which layers game elements like points and badges onto existing activities, GBL involves designing games that intrinsically align with learning objectives [@papastergiou2009]. Research suggests that GBL can promote sustained motivation and deepen learning in Computer Science (CS) education [@ardic2021], but its application to peer feedback remains under-explored. While gamified PCR environments have shown promise [@indriasari2023], more integrative, meaningfully playful approaches may better support student motivation. Specifically, this study examines whether embedding PCR within a GBL framework improves the quality of student feedback and influences their perceived competence, autonomy, and relatedness, as conceptualized by Self-Determination Theory (SDT).

The study took place at a CEGEP in Quebec, Canada, as part of a post-secondary CS program. Third-year students participated in a pre-post experimental design that integrated a custom-designed card game into the PCR process. The game's mechanics were tied to the quality of peer feedback provided, introducing a strategic layer in which in-game advantages were earned through meaningful academic participation. A mixed-methods approach was used: feedback quality was evaluated using a code review taxonomy, motivation was assessed through pre/post surveys, and qualitative reflections provided insight into students' perceptions of the intervention.

Findings from this research contribute to an emerging dialogue at the intersection of feedback practices, motivation theory, and game-based pedagogy. By examining how GBL can support better quality peer feedback, the study offers practical guidance for educators seeking to cultivate intrinsic motivation in CS classrooms.
