Peer Code Review (PCR) is a key practice in Computer Science (CS) education, yet students often struggle to provide meaningful feedback. Self-Determination Theory (SDT) highlights the importance of competence, autonomy, and relatedness in sustaining intrinsic motivation, but traditional peer review methods often fail to support these needs. While gamification has been used to enhance motivation, its reliance on extrinsic rewards may not lead to lasting improvements in feedback quality.

This study explores Game-Based Learning (GBL) as an alternative approach to increasing intrinsic motivation and feedback quality in CS PCR. Using a mixed-methods, quasi-experimental design, 42 third-year CS students enrolled in a CEGEP-level Game Programming course participated in PCR before engaging in a card-based game intervention rooted in the game design theory of meaningful play. In-game resources were tied to prior feedback quality, creating a competitive incentive structure. a Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test assessed feedback improvements, while pre- and post-test results measured changes in motivation using independent _t_-tests. Additionally, a thematic analysis of open-ended responses revealed student perspectives on motivation and game design.

Results indicate a significant pre-post increase in feedback quality ($p=0.02, N=37$) and autonomy ($p=0.01, N=39$). However, the changes in perceived competence and relatedness were not statistically significant. These findings contribute to research on GBL in CS education, highlighting its potential to enhance student motivation and learning outcomes in PCR settings.
