Peer Code Review (PCR) is a key practice in Computer Science (CS) education, yet students often struggle to provide meaningful feedback. Self-Determination Theory (SDT) highlights the importance of autonomy, competence, and relatedness in sustaining intrinsic motivation, but traditional peer review methods often fail to support these needs. This study explores Game-Based Learning (GBL) as an alternative approach to increasing intrinsic motivation and feedback quality in CS PCR. Using a mixed-methods, quasi-experimental design, 42 third-year CEGEP-level CS students participated in PCR before engaging in a card-based game intervention rooted in the game design theory of meaningful play. In-game resources were tied to prior feedback quality, creating a competitive incentive structure. A Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test assessed feedback improvements, while pre- and post-test results measured changes in motivation using independent _t_-tests. Additionally, a thematic analysis of open-ended responses revealed student perspectives on motivation and game design. Results indicate a significant pre-post increase in feedback quality ($p=0.03, N=37$) and autonomy ($p=0.01, N=39$), but not competence or relatedness. These findings contribute to research on GBL in CS education, highlighting its potential to enhance student motivation and learning outcomes in PCR settings. This study suggests that GBL can be an effective strategy for promoting higher motivation with peer feedback in technical disciplines. By embedding academic effort into playful systems, educators may cultivate more motivated learners, especially in peer-driven learning environments.
