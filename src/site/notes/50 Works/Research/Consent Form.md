## Purpose

This project is being conducted by Vikram Singh, a Computer Science Teacher at John Abbott College, for the completion of a Master’s Degree in College Teaching, accredited by the Université de Sherbrooke. This study explores how different approaches to peer code review affect student motivation and feedback quality.

## Procedure

1. Before beginning the activity, you’ll complete a short survey regarding your perspectives on peer feedback.
2. You will participate in a brief card game related to your course material.
3. After the card game, you’ll complete a survey about your experience.
4. Your feedback on the course assignments, along with survey responses, will be analyzed to better understand factors influencing feedback quality and student motivation in peer code review.

## Potential Risks & Benefits

There are no known risks for participation in this study.

By investigating what makes peer code review motivating (or not), your participation could lead to the design of interventions that make peer code review a more engaging and beneficial process for everyone. Your participation could help students develop stronger feedback skills, crucial for both their success in CS courses and future careers. The findings could provide valuable information to your instructor and others about how to refine peer code review practices, potentially leading to widespread changes that enhance the learning experience for many CS students. For your interest, the results of the study will be sent to you after the study has been completed, if so desired.

## Confidentiality

Your participation in this study is confidential in the following ways:

1. Your name will not appear in the research results.
2. The researcher/teacher will never know if you agree or do not agree to participate in this study, therefore the choice to participate or not has no impact on your final grade, nor on any future interaction with your teacher.
3. The survey results will be anonymous and kept for five years in Microsoft OneDrive behind two-factor authentication.
4. The Microsoft Forms questionnaire will be completed anonymously and your personal information will not be revealed. The servers for Microsoft Forms and OneDrive are stored in Canada and therefore your data is protected by Canadian laws.

Your participation in this research is completely voluntary. You have the right to not consent or withdraw consent at any time. If you have any questions about the content or methods of this study, please feel free to contact the teacher/researcher, Vikram Singh, at [vikram.singh@johnabbott.qc.ca](mailto:vikram.singh@johnabbott.qc.ca) or the supervisor, Paul Darvasi, at [paul.darvasi@usherbrooke.ca](mailto:paul.darvasi@usherbrooke.ca).

If you have any questions about your rights or treatment during this study, please contact the Research and Innovation Officer at JAC, Teresa Hackett, at [teresa.hackett@johnabbott.qc.ca](mailto:teresa.hackett@johnabbott.qc.ca).
