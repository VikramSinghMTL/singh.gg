## 1. Pre-Post Survey Results

To assess changes in students' attitudes toward peer feedback, a pre-post survey was conducted. Likert-scale responses were analyzed using paired t-tests to determine statistically significant differences before and after the intervention. The results are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1: Pre-Post Likert Scale Comparison

| Statement                                                              | Pre-Mean (SD) | Post-Mean (SD) | t      | p-value | Significance |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------ | ------- | ------------ |
| I enjoy providing feedback to my peers.                                | 3.36 (0.98)   | 3.79 (0.95)    | -2.036 | 0.045   | Yes          |
| I usually put a lot of effort into the feedback I give.                | 3.76 (0.98)   | 3.87 (0.98)    | -0.504 | 0.616   | No           |
| I believe the feedback I give is helpful in improving my peers' work.  | 3.43 (0.91)   | 3.74 (0.97)    | -1.505 | 0.136   | No           |
| I believe the peer feedback I receive is useful for improving my work. | 3.36 (1.12)   | 3.21 (1.00)    | 0.643  | 0.522   | No           |
| I feel confident about my feedback improving others' work.             | 3.24 (0.82)   | 3.44 (0.91)    | -1.023 | 0.309   | No           |
| I feel in control of the peer feedback I provide.                      | 4.05 (0.70)   | 3.44 (1.07)    | 3.022  | 0.0036  | Yes          |
| I feel connected to my peers when giving/receiving feedback.           | 3.21 (1.09)   | 3.54 (1.17)    | -1.288 | 0.202   | No           |
| I am motivated to give quality peer feedback.                          | 3.55 (1.02)   | 4.15 (0.99)    | -2.721 | 0.008   | Yes          |
| I feel anxious when giving peer feedback.                              | 2.62 (1.32)   | 2.26 (1.33)    | 1.228  | 0.223   | No           |

Significant differences were observed in enjoyment of providing feedback (p = 0.045), perceived impact of the game on control over feedback (p = 0.0036), and motivation to give quality feedback (p = 0.008). As seen in Figure 1, these findings suggest that students reported greater enjoyment and motivation after the intervention. However, the lower post-test mean for control indicates that students did not feel that the game increased their sense of autonomy over peer feedback. No significant differences were found in effort, perceived usefulness, confidence, peer connection, or anxiety levels, suggesting that while motivation improved, other perceptions remained unchanged.

### 2. Peer Feedback Quality Analysis

To assess the impact of the intervention on peer feedback quality, a statistical comparison was performed on pre and post-feedback samples. Since the data violated normality assumptions (Shapiro-Wilk p = 0.0002), a Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used instead of a paired t-test. Results are summarized in Table 2.

Table 2: Pre-Post Peer Feedback Quality Comparison

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Test|Test Statistic|p-value|Significance|
|Paired t-Test|t = 3.19|0.0019|Yes|
|Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test|W = 641.5|0.0017|Yes|

Both statistical tests confirmed a significant improvement in peer feedback quality (p < 0.05), indicating that the intervention led to more detailed and constructive feedback from students. Despite the lack of change in reported effort, the increase in quality suggests that students refined their feedback strategies rather than simply working harder.

### 3. Qualitative Analysis of Student Responses

Students provided open-ended responses about their experiences with the intervention. Thematic analysis identified key categories of responses, summarized in Table 3.

Table 3: Thematic Breakdown of Student Feedback

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Theme|Number of Responses|
|Increased motivation due to game mechanics|21|
|No significant change in feedback approach|8|
|Awareness of feedback impact but not strongly motivated|6|
|Perceived pressure or lack of understanding|4|

A majority (21 students) reported that the game-based intervention increased their motivation to provide better feedback, aligning with the quantitative results on motivation improvement. However, 8 students indicated no significant impact, and 6 students noted increased awareness of feedback quality but did not feel it strongly influenced their approach. Four students reported feeling pressured or unclear on the game’s role in feedback, suggesting variability in how the intervention was perceived.

### 4. Visualization of Key Results

### 5. Summary of Findings

The results indicate that students' enjoyment of providing feedback and their motivation to give quality feedback significantly increased after the intervention. Statistical analyses confirmed a measurable improvement in peer feedback quality, supported by both parametric and non-parametric tests. However, students did not perceive the game as increasing their sense of control over feedback, as indicated by the significant decrease in post-test scores for this measure. This suggests that while the game successfully enhanced motivation, it did not necessarily foster greater autonomy in the feedback process. Qualitative responses reinforced these findings, with many students reporting heightened motivation and a more strategic approach to providing feedback. However, individual differences in engagement were observed, with some students expressing no significant change in their approach and a small subset reporting feeling pressured or unclear about the game’s role in feedback. Despite the measurable increase in feedback quality, students' perceptions of effort and usefulness of feedback remained unchanged, suggesting that improvements were more implicit than consciously recognized. These findings establish a solid foundation for evaluating the intervention’s impact, which will be explored in the discussion section.
