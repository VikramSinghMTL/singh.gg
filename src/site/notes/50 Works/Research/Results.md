## 4.0 Pre-Test Findings

Before evaluating the impact of the game-based learning intervention, a pre-test was conducted to assess participants' gaming preferences, prior exposure to game-based learning, and familiarity with card-based mechanics. These contextual findings provide insight into students' receptiveness to the intervention.

### 4.0.1 Gaming Preferences

The majority of students reported a strong preference for games, with **a mean of 4.64 (on a 5-point scale)** for the statement *"I enjoy playing games (analogue or digital)."* Additionally, **39 out of 42** participants stated they enjoy playing video games, while many also enjoy board games (28) and card games (26). This indicates that students were generally predisposed to game-based learning, making the intervention a natural fit.

### 4.0.2 Prior Experience with Game-Based Learning

When asked about their prior experience with game-based learning in other courses, **only 2 students** reported frequent exposure, while the majority (24) had rarely engaged in such learning activities, and **10 had never participated in game-based learning.** This suggests that the intervention was a novel experience for most students, potentially impacting their engagement and response to the approach.

### 4.0.3 Familiarity with Card Games

Since the intervention incorporated a card-based peer feedback game, students were also asked about their familiarity with card games. **40 out of 42 students** reported being at least somewhat familiar with card games, suggesting that minimal onboarding was needed to introduce the mechanics.

## 4.1 Peer Feedback Quality

Each student provided three separate peer feedback scores. To ensure a representative individual score per student, the median of these three scores was calculated before conducting the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

To address the first research question—whether the game-based learning intervention increased the quality of peer feedback during computer science peer code review—a **Wilcoxon signed-rank test** was conducted on the median preand post-intervention feedback scores. This non-parametric test was selected due to the **paired** nature of the data.

The results indicated that **post-intervention feedback scores (Mdn = 4.0)** were significantly higher than **pre-intervention scores (Mdn = 3.0)**, **W = 42.0, z = -4.67, p =.0018**. Given that the p-value is below the conventional alpha level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that the game-based learning intervention had a measurable impact on improving the quality of peer feedback.

## 4.2 Self-Determination Theory Constructs

The second research question examined whether the game-based learning intervention influenced students' **perceived autonomy, competence, and relatedness**, as conceptualized by Self-Determination Theory (SDT). Independent **t-tests assuming equal variances** were conducted for each construct, comparing preand post-intervention mean scores.

The results are summarized in **Table 1**.

### Table 1. T-Test Results for Autonomy, Competence, and Relatedness

| Construct   | t-statistic | p-value | Significance (p < 0.05) |
|------------|------------|---------|-------------------------|
| **Autonomy**   | -2.54       | 0.013   | **Yes**                 |
| **Competence** | -0.39       | 0.695   | No                      |
| **Relatedness**| -2.00       | 0.058   | No                      |

The results indicate a **statistically significant increase** in students' **perceived autonomy** following the intervention (**t = -2.54, p = 0.013**). However, no significant differences were observed in students' **perceived competence** (**t = -0.39, p = 0.695**) or **relatedness** (**t = -2.00, p = 0.058**) at the **α = 0.05** threshold.

![Pre-Test vs. Post-Test Scores by Category.png](/img/user/00%20System/Assets/Pre-Test%20vs.%20Post-Test%20Scores%20by%20Category.png)

These findings suggest that while the intervention successfully enhanced students' **sense of autonomy**, it did not produce a statistically significant effect on their **sense of competence or relatedness**.

## 4.3 Engagement with the Peer Feedback Game

As a secondary measure of the intervention’s effectiveness, students were asked to rate their enjoyment of the peer feedback card game. The results indicate a **high level of engagement**, with a **mean of 4.79 (on a 5-point scale)** and a **median and mode of 5**, suggesting that most students strongly agreed that they enjoyed playing the game.

This overwhelmingly positive reception supports the feasibility of game-based learning in peer code review. The qualitative insights and student feedback regarding gameplay mechanics, motivation, and the impact on their feedback approach will be further analyzed in the Discussion section.

## 4.4 Qualitative Analysis of Student Responses

Students provided open-ended responses about their experiences with the intervention. A thematic analysis identified key categories of responses, summarized in **Table 3**.

### Table 3. Thematic Breakdown of Student Feedback

| Theme | Number of Responses |
|------------------------------|----------------|
| Increased motivation due to game mechanics | 21 |
| No significant change in feedback approach | 8 |
| Awareness of feedback impact but not strongly motivated | 6 |
| Perceived pressure or lack of understanding | 4 |

A majority (21 students) reported that the game-based intervention **increased their motivation** to provide better feedback, aligning with the quantitative results on motivation improvement. However, 8 students indicated no significant impact, and 6 students noted **increased awareness of feedback quality** but did not feel it strongly influenced their approach. Four students reported **feeling pressured or unclear on the game’s role in feedback**, suggesting variability in how the intervention was perceived.
