In the context of 2D games, the most fundamental way of looking at the world is by using the 2D coordinate system.

Slightly different from the traditional coordinate system you might've used in Math class, the 2D coordinate system we're referring to here is a system in which objects have an X and Y coordinate (X, Y) and are drawn accordingly, with (0, 0) being the top-left of the system. This means positive directions moving down and to the right, while negative directions move up and to the left. [^1]
