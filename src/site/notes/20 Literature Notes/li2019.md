> Formative peer assessment is widely used in education to foster student learning. However, it is critical to provide students with assessment training before engaging them in peer assessment, as students may not be capable of understanding marking criteria and critically assessing their peers. The present study examined the eﬀects of gamed-based assessment training on students’ assessment skills and intrinsic motivation. A sample of 48 students participated in two peer assessment training modules; one control group was given the traditional, calibrated training and the treatment group received the game-based training. Data analysis indicated no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in students’ assessment skills between the two groups. Nevertheless, students in the gamebased group showed a signiﬁcantly higher level of intrinsic motivation than students in the calibrated training group. Qualitative analysis of students’ reﬂection essays conﬁrmed the quantitative ﬁndings that game-based training may have improved students’ intrinsic motivation. Implications and limitations are discussed.
