> The following paper presents the model for introduction of gamification into the field of e-learning in higher education. Concepts and differences between techniques and methods of game-mechanics and game dynamics are explained. With proper integration of gamification in the field of e-learning into higher education, a positive impact on the learning process can be achieved, such as higher satisfaction, motivation and greater engagement of students. The importance of clearly defined objectives, rules, techniques and mechanisms of gamification that affect the dynamics of the students is shown. The paper presents a comprehensive view of the gamification concept in higher education. The advantages and disadvantages of introducing gamification in e-learning are described. The paper combines the characteristics of gamification with e-learning and shows the possibilities of use in practical.
