> The recent experimental literature on reward contingency effects on intrinsic motivation is reviewed. Agreement emerges among investigators for most contingency effects when experimental procedures are referred to using a standardized terminology. However, some discrepancies are apparent, especially with respect to performance-contingent effects that have both increased and decreased intrinsic motivation relative to task-contingent effects. These discrepancies are discussed in terms of cognitive evaluation theory (Deci & Ryan, 1980), and an integration of the various effects is proposed and tested using male and female college students (N = 96) working on a puzzle-solving activity for whom various reward conditions were in effect. The results of the study and review suggest that it is the relative salience of controlling and informational aspects of rewards that mediate the contingency effects. The review and study underscore the importance of the interpersonal context of reward administration for the facilitation or undermining of intrinsic motivation.
