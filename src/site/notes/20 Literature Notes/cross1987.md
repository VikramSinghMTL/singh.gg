> The practice of software reviewing includes a collection of techniques for achieving management control of the software development process, improvements in software quality, improved productivity, and professional growth (IEEE, 1985). A variety of interacting factors influence the effectiveness of software reviewing, but the complementary, constructive insight of reviewers is the basis for helpful review outcomes.
