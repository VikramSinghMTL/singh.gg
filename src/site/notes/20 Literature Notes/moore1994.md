> [!insights]+
> The Perry schema describes a progression in students’ cognitive development from absolute, dualistic thinking (right vs. wrong) to more complex, relativistic perspectives where knowledge is context-dependent and individuals make informed commitments.

> [!summary]+
> - **Stages of Development**:
> 	- **Dualism (Positions 1-2)**: Knowledge is seen as black-and-white, taught by authoritative figures.
> 	- **Multiplicity (Positions 3-4)**: Acknowledgement of multiple perspectives, with uncertainty seen as temporary.
> 	- **Contextual Relativism (Position 5)**: Recognition that knowledge depends on context and that individuals play an active role in meaning-making.
> 	- **Commitment within Relativism (Positions 6-9)**: Mature engagement where individuals make personal, thoughtful commitments amidst uncertainty.
> - **Implications for Teaching**: The schema emphasizes the importance of fostering environments that challenge students’ thinking and support them through stages of increasing cognitive complexity.
> - **Empathy for Students**: Understanding where students are in their cognitive development helps educators design learning experiences that support transitions and reduce frustration.
