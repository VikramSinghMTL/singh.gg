> [!abstract]+
> The utilization of technology can be implemented in education. Gamification is a new technology that used elements such as badges, level, and point of game play that implemented in a non-game context. In this research, the researcher analyzes some of the literature to establish in the extent of gamification to assist student’s motivation and engagement among Computer Science related subject. The researcher found that the most common element that implemented in learning Computer Science related subject were badges, point, level, and leaderboards. Implementing gamification elements in learning can be a tool that can motivate and engage the student in learning Computer Science.

> [!questions]+
>
> 1. Analyze the existing research to find common gamification elements that are used in classrooms, the impact of gamification on motivation and engagement in learning. ([@oktaviati2018, 121](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GXUBRAV8?page=2&annotation=T653INKB))

> [!methodology]+
>
> 1. The researchers looked for articles (between 2010-2018) with keywords like "gamification and learning", "gamification in Computer Science", "effect of gamification in learning", "gamification and higher education". These words were refined using databases such as IEEE, Science Direct and Google Scholar. ([@oktaviati2018, 122](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GXUBRAV8?page=3&annotation=JTQ7P7H5))
> 2. They used a qualitative meta-analysis. ([@oktaviati2018, 122](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GXUBRAV8?page=3&annotation=LQMEI95T))

>     - People love badges and points.
> 2. The most elements examined by research are leaderboards, badges and reward, point, and level. ([@oktaviati2018, 122](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GXUBRAV8?page=3&annotation=LECLKKPM))
>     - It's like all this.
> 3. Some students found that badges can motivate them in learning, the one-third did not find that badges motivate their work while the one-third remaining felt indifferent [30]. Contrary with [25] which finds that badges and leaderboards has negative effect in learning, students tend to score lower and less motivation than the student with non-gamified. ([@oktaviati2018, 123](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GXUBRAV8?page=4&annotation=FMSBMU9P))
>     - Badges no good.
> 4. To be successful in gamification, one of the key is ensuring appropriate scaffolding, progression and sequence in content and do not make the students frustrated but ensure the suitable level for user or students [32]. ([@oktaviati2018, 123](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GXUBRAV8?page=4&annotation=MBNFK6XQ))
>     - Proper scaffolding is needed.
> 5. For some students, leaderboards give them motivation [15]. But, there was one studies reported that using element leaderboards was not enjoy the student in learning [25]. ([@oktaviati2018, 123](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GXUBRAV8?page=4&annotation=UX9VVXQ8))
>     - It's all the same. Some students like points/levels/leaderboards and some students don't.
> 6. Majority, the result of study above reported positive impact. ([@oktaviati2018, 124](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GXUBRAV8?page=5&annotation=S6SNSQAA))

>     - Definition.
> 2. Gamification can be used to assist student’s motivation and engagement among Computer Science ([@oktaviati2018, 121](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GXUBRAV8?page=2&annotation=BPSTBDF3))
> 3. Students find learning Computer Science is difficult, the presentation of material can be boring, and lack of interest and motivation [6]. ([@oktaviati2018, 121](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GXUBRAV8?page=2&annotation=YHWRIP2G))
