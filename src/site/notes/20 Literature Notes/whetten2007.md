> Emphasizes that effective course design begins with clear learning outcomes and aligns activities and assessments to support student-centered learning.

> [!summary]+
> - **Shift to Learning-Centered Design**: Whetten emphasizes the importance of focusing on learning outcomes, not just teaching methods. He highlights the paradigm shift from a teaching-centric approach to one where course design directly supports learning objectives.
> - **Three Key Components**: Effective course design involves clear learning objectives, aligned learning activities, and valid assessments that reinforce those objectives.
> - **Active Learning**: Courses should include active learning strategies that engage students in discovering knowledge, not just passively receiving it.
> - **Assessment as a Learning Tool**: Assessments should go beyond testing for comprehension and include feedback mechanisms to facilitate deeper learning.
> - **Backward Design**: Whetten advocates for starting with the end goal (assessments) and designing course activities to prepare students for these assessments.
