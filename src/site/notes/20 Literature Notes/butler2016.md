> Despite rapid growth and the promise of a lucrative degree, the attrition rate for students studying Computer Science is high. Computer Science learning is a difficult, tedious process with a heavy workload which demands a lot from those studying it. A student who loses motivation or interest in the field is more likely to find a new area of study. In order to keep students interested and motivated, difficult concepts need to be taught in new, more engaging and interactive ways that feel fun. Students are willing to take on hard, frustrating, and even time-consuming challenges within video games for intangible rewards and feelings of accomplishment. Therefore, our goal is to gamify Computer Science learning to achieve the same levels of engagement and fulfillment as video games do. To do so, we have begun development of a serious game that introduces CS concepts in a fun and interactive way. To measure the level of interest and engagement brought on by this game, we let volunteers from CS as well as in other majors play our prototype. After playing the games, each volunteer filled out a survey comparing their enjoyment in learning through games as opposed to traditional classroom learning. With this feedback we concluded that gamification is key in changing the learning experience for CS students and will help them achieve their learning goals.

> [!questions]+
>
> 1. Educational games have been proven to generate more effective learning outcomes and more motivation than other approaches and need further exploration in teaching CS concepts over programming skills as well as focusing on older students as opposed to children [5]. This study intends to further establish the needs of CS learners, which will shape development of an engaging and interactive learning game.

> 1. constructivist model ([@butler2016, 237](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8WEHI2E9?page=1&annotation=FQU5AR8T))
>     - Theoretical framework.
> 2. They used Unity to create games to teach data structures like stacks and queues as well as algos like selection sort. True or false questions are answered at the end to assess learning. The narrative is you're a space cadet that has to provide instructions to a robot to carry out tasks. ([@butler2016, 237](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8WEHI2E9?page=1&annotation=UZ646Z2T))
> 3. 20 anonymous volunteers played the selection sort game, after which they were given a 15 question survey to complete. The survey asked them things about their learning style preferences and if the game was a fun way to learn computer science topics.

> [!conclusion]+
>
> 1. Q9. If learning is more like a game, I am more motivated to learn. It is clear from Q9 (Fig. 4 above) that if learning is more like a game then motivation will improve. 45% of respondents agreed, while 40% strongly agreed. 10% were neutral and 5% disagreed. ([@butler2016, 239](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8WEHI2E9?page=3&annotation=W7SAWSNQ))
>     - Participants perception is that if learning is more like a game, they are more motivated to learn.
> 2. Q10. Learning through games makes difficult concepts more approachable. Difficult concepts can become overwhelming for learners and may scare them away before an understanding is even attempted, so it is important to portray challenging material in a way that is more approachable and gently introduced. 45% of respondents strongly agreed, and 50% agreed that games can help with this. ([@butler2016, 239](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8WEHI2E9?page=3&annotation=VFW6YWBP))
>     - Participants say that games can make difficult concepts more approachable.
> 3. Students will be provided with a stress free, self-paced way to learn and will keep up their motivation in classes that are no longer too demanding or boring but rather are as enjoyable as the games they play outside of class.

> [!insights]+
>
> 1. Between 40-50% of students who enroll in Computer Science either drop out or switch majors, usually within the first two years of their study [1]. One-third of students who take an introductory CS course worldwide are unable to pass [2]. ([@butler2016, 237](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8WEHI2E9?page=1&annotation=7ZRNKG3K))
> 2. Students are well aware of the benefits of the CS major but are getting discouraged from reaching the finish line and receiving the degree. ([@butler2016, 237](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8WEHI2E9?page=1&annotation=PYMLSVZW))
> 3. The game needs to develop in ways that mimic current popular games so that players see it as fun and competitive and not think of it as an educational game. ([@butler2016, 240](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/8WEHI2E9?page=4&annotation=CATDMQZ7))
>     - Yeah not just kahoot all the things.
