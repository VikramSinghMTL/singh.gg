> 1. It’s not what teachers do, it’s what students do that is the important thing. ([@biggs2012, 44](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/43P2JWJ5?page=7&annotation=P2URXHK8))
> 2. The students are “entrapped” in this web of consistency, optimising the likelihood that they will engage the appropriate learning activities. ([@biggs2012, 45](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/43P2JWJ5?page=8&annotation=THP39H3M))

> [!summary]+
> - **Constructive Alignment**: Biggs introduces the concept of _constructive alignment_, where teaching, learning activities (TLAs), and assessment tasks are aligned with learning objectives to ensure students engage in deep learning.
> - **Student-Centered Focus**: Effective teaching emphasizes what the student does, shifting away from teacher-centered strategies. The goal is to engage students in meaningful, higher-order learning activities.
> - **Approaches to Learning**: Biggs highlights the difference between _surface_ and _deep_ learning approaches, originally described by Marton and Säljö (1976). Surface learning is linked to rote memorization, while deep learning involves understanding and connecting concepts.
> - **Levels of Teaching**: Biggs outlines three levels of teaching:
> 	1. **Level 1**: Focuses on what the student is (blame-the-student model).
> 	2. **Level 2**: Focuses on what the teacher does (teaching techniques).
> 	3. **Level 3**: Focuses on what the student does to achieve learning outcomes (constructive alignment).
> - **Teaching Implications**: Good teaching “entraps” students in a web of learning activities that promote deep engagement, using objectives expressed with verbs indicating levels of cognitive activity.
