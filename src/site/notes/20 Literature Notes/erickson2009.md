> - **Progression from Memorization to Thinking**:
> 	- **Knowing**: Students begin with memorization to form a basis for thought.
> 	- **Understanding**: Students recognize relationships between specific examples and general concepts.
> 	- **Thinking**: Students apply knowledge to solve problems, requiring them to create or analyze beyond given information.
> - **Practice and Connection**: For students to retain information, they must practice retrieving and connecting it to their prior knowledge, making learning meaningful.
> - **Complex Problem Solving**: Teaching should include both structured and unstructured problems to develop studentsâ€™ critical thinking skills.
> - **Learning How to Learn**: First-year students often lack study skills and metacognitive awareness. Instruction should incorporate strategies for self-monitoring and reflection.
