> - Organizations that adopt SMART practices often see improvements in alignment, accountability, and results.

> [!summary]+
> In his seminal article, George T. Doran introduces the acronym **SMART**, a framework for setting effective objectives that are:
>
> - **Specific**: Focused on a particular area for improvement.
> - **Measurable**: Quantifiable or indicative of progress.
> - **Assignable**: Clear about who is responsible.
> - **Realistic**: Achievable within given resources.
> - **Time-related**: Bound by a timeframe for completion.
> 
> Doran argues that the process of setting clear objectives is often misunderstood or avoided due to the anxiety it generates among managers. By simplifying the process with SMART, organizations can foster better communication, reduce stress, and integrate goal-setting into everyday management practices.
