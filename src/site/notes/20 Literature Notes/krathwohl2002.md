> [!insights]+
> Highlights the importance of the revised Bloom’s Taxonomy, which integrates knowledge dimensions with cognitive processes to create comprehensive and aligned learning experiences.

> [!summary]+
> - **Two-Dimensional Structure**: The revised taxonomy introduces a two-dimensional framework, combining the _Knowledge_ dimension (Factual, Conceptual, Procedural, and Metacognitive) with the _Cognitive Process_ dimension (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create). This setup allows for clearer classification of learning objectives and better curriculum alignment.
> - **Hierarchical Organization**: The revised taxonomy retains a hierarchical structure but acknowledges overlap between categories, making it more adaptable to real-world educational settings.
> - **Focus on Metacognitive Knowledge**: The addition of Metacognitive Knowledge highlights the importance of students’ awareness of their own cognitive processes, promoting learning strategies that go beyond content absorption.
> - **Expanded Definitions**: Categories were updated to reflect modern educational language, such as renaming Synthesis to Create, emphasizing the ability to generate new and coherent ideas.
