> [!summary]+
> Keengwe & Onchwari (2011) argue that while schools have increased access to technology, many teachers are not effectively integrating it into their instruction. The article emphasizes constructivist pedagogy, which promotes active, meaningful learning through hands-on experiences and collaboration. The authors highlight that teachers often use technology for personal purposes but hesitate to incorporate it into their teaching, often due to limited professional development and institutional barriers.  
>  
> The study also notes that constructivist teachers are more likely to use technology effectively, as they view learning as a student-driven process rather than direct content transmission. Successful technology integration occurs when teachers intentionally align tools with curriculum goals, rather than using them as isolated supplements. The authors stress the importance of teacher training, administrative support, and professional learning communities to help educators navigate challenges and leverage technology for deeper student engagement.

> [!insights]+
> 1. Technology does not guarantee learning—simply placing digital tools in classrooms is insufficient; effective integration requires pedagogical intent.
> 2. Constructivist pedagogy supports meaningful learning by encouraging active, hands-on experiences, social interaction, and knowledge construction.
> 3. Teachers often use technology more for personal tasks than for instruction, highlighting a gap in professional development and pedagogical training.
> 4. Technology shifts the teacher's role from content provider to learning facilitator, requiring them to scaffold knowledge and guide exploration.
> 5. Effective technology integration depends on teacher beliefs—those with constructivist approaches are more likely to use technology for student-centered learning.
> 6. Barriers to technology integration include lack of time, resources, training, and institutional support, reinforcing the need for strong professional learning communities.
> 7. True technology integration happens when tech supports curriculum goals—not as an add-on, but as an embedded, purposeful component of learning activities.
