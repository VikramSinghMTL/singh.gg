> - **Quality of Engagement**: The quality of student learning is directly related to how they engage with learning tasks. Deep approaches lead to better outcomes, fostering understanding and long-term retention, while surface approaches result in poor learning quality and temporary recall.
> - **Influence of Teaching**: Effective teaching should create conditions that encourage a deep approach, emphasizing meaning, relevance, and integration. Surface learning often arises when students feel pressured by assessments or overloaded with content.
> - **Imitation Learning**: Ramsden warns against _imitation learning_, where students learn in a superficial way, memorizing without genuine understanding. This can give the illusion of learning but lacks lasting educational value.
