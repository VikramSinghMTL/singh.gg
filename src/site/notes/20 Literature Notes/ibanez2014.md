> Gamiﬁcation is the use of game design elements in non-game settings to engage participants and encourage desired behaviors. It has been identiﬁed as a promising technique to improve students’ engagement which could have a positive impact on learning. This study evaluated the learning effectiveness and engagement appeal of a gamiﬁed learning activity targeted at the learning of C-programming language. Furthermore, the study inquired into which gamiﬁed learning activities were more appealing to students. The study was conducted using the mixed-method sequential explanatory protocol. The data collected and analysed included logs, questionnaires, and preand post-tests. The results of the evaluation show positive effects on the engagement of students toward the gamiﬁed learning activities and a moderate improvement in learning outcomes. Students reported different motivations for continuing and stopping activities once they completed the mandatory assignment. The preferences for different gamiﬁed activities were also conditioned by academic milestones.

> 1. In the game design arena, Lazzaro identiﬁes four keys to unlocking players’ emotions: 1) providing opportunities for challenge, strategy, and problem solving (hard fun); 2) introducing elements that foster mystery, intrigue, and curiosity (easy fun); 3) leading players to excitement or relief moods (altered states); and 4) promoting competition and teamwork (people fun) [17]. On the other hand, LeBlanc organises the types of player pleasure into eight categories: sensation, fantasy, narrative, challenge, fellowship, discovery, expression, and submission [18] ([@ibanez2014a, 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9QP7CCPN?page=2&annotation=RBTJM3WJ))

> 2. From the perspective of a video game designer who is now devoted to making engaging e-learning software, Raymer [33] states that the setting of goals and objectives, feedback, and rewards are the key components for developing gamiﬁed learning environments. Goals and objectives need to be split into achievable steps that learners could accomplish by using their skills; designers should keep students within their ﬂow channel [16]. Feedback is included to avoid students getting lost or confused about what to do and how to do it within the learning environment; it is also important to inform students about the progress they have made. Finally, Raymer [33] recommends the use of rewards to acknowledge students for their work and effort, and highlights the relevance of broadcasting this information throughout the learning community to foster peer motivation. Similarly, the taxonomy of satisfaction metrics for gamiﬁed e-learning [34] includes the need to provide manageable tasks (context) for learners, trying to keep them working within the ﬂow channel through mechanics. The taxonomy also states the need to provide feedback and information about progress as well as the social and competitive elements necessary to promote learners’ engagement.

> 3. Nicholson [35] presents a user-centred theoretical framework which recommends: 1) designing considering the beneﬁts for the user; 2) focusing on introducing fun elements instead of elements of scoring; 3) offering the possibility of choosing different ways to achieve users’ goals; and 4) integrating game mechanics into the non-game setting. We will base the design of our gamiﬁed environment on Nicholson’s framework. ([@ibanez2014a, 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9QP7CCPN?page=2&annotation=SLUUFH4I))

> 4. To this end, and based on the overview of the research literature, the Q-Learning-G platform was designed. The platform includes basic elements of game mechanics where students increase their levels of expertise by introducing and assessing questions related to C-programming language. The experiment was conducted to address the following hypotheses: H1. Students will work beyond the learning requirements of the course. H2. Students will change their learning strategy once they achieve the learning requirements of the course. H3. Students will gain knowledge of C-programming language by using the Q-Learning-G platform. The secondary purposes of the study were: 1) to understand students’ reasons for continuing or stopping work once the learning requirements were achieved, and 2) to identify students’ preferences for gamiﬁed learning activities.

> [!conclusion]+

> 1. It can be concluded that students improved their comprehension of C-programming language as a result of the use of the gamiﬁed platform. ([@ibanez2014a, 9](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9QP7CCPN?page=9&annotation=J55CY99U))
>     - Positive results.
> 2. Among the most common reasons for continuing work after achieving 100 points were to collect all the badges and to keep learning. Collecting badges was the most effective driver of participation and lack of badges discouraged students from continuing work. ([@ibanez2014a, 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9QP7CCPN?page=10&annotation=9ZA2VKMT))
>     - Badges r goated.
> 3. These ﬁndings reinforce the idea that a learning activity combining game elements in a gamiﬁed learning environment can engage students in achieving their main goal: to learn [35]. ([@ibanez2014a, 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9QP7CCPN?page=10&annotation=JT4T5KQD))

> [!insights]+
>
> 1. Most of the gamiﬁed frameworks, for example Khan Academy, use points and badges to reward progress and levels of expertise acquired by learners whereas the most extensive game dynamic used is competitiveness through leaderboards [22], [26], [27], [28]. However, there has been controversy in reference to the use of rewards in learning environments. Whereas some authors argue that extrinsic rewards have negative effects on students’ self-motivation to learn [29], others claim that the risks are minimised once users understand the relevance of the activity for themselves [30], [31]. ([@ibanez2014a, 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9QP7CCPN?page=2&annotation=LQ9D7S22))
>     - Extrinsic vs. intrinsic motivations.
> 2. Further studies are necessary to explore the impact of these reward elements in gamiﬁed learning activities. ([@ibanez2014a, 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9QP7CCPN?page=2&annotation=JG3ED3F8))
