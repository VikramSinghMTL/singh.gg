Metacognition is being contextually aware of oneself during the learning process. It is often described as, "thinking about thinking". One aspect of metacognition is being able to recognize and distinguish between things you understand and things you do not understand. Further, metacognition asks questions like:

- "What went wrong initially?"
- "Who can I ask about this?"
- "Why don't I understand this?"
- "What questions do I need to ask to lead me to the right answer?"
- "How can I formulate these questions such that my search is fruitful?"

Once you can identify the gaps in your knowledge, you're one step further to filling in those gaps.
