[[20 Literature Notes/doran1981\|SMART]] is a widely used framework for setting clear and actionable goals [@doran1981].

## The SMART Acronym

- **S – Specific**: Clearly define what you want to achieve. Avoid vague or broad objectives.
  - Example: "Read one chapter about the bubble sort algorithm" is specific, while "Learn about algorithms" is not.
  
- **M – Measurable**: Quantify progress or success. Add metrics or criteria.
  - Example: "Write a program using three different sorting algorithms" is measurable.

- **A – Achievable**: Set goals that are realistic given resources and constraints.
  - Example: "Understand recursion basics" is achievable for beginners; "Master advanced algorithmic analysis" might not be.

- **R – Relevant**: Align objectives with broader goals or needs.
  - Example: "Use sorting algorithms to optimize database queries" is relevant to a computer science course.

- **T – Time-bound**: Include a deadline or timeframe.
  - Example: "Complete a peer-reviewed coding assignment by the end of the week."
