Both Baxter Magolda’s [-@baxtermagolda1992] _Responsive Teaching_ and Moore’s [-@moore1994] take on the _Perry Schema_ look at how students move from seeing knowledge as fixed to understanding it as something more complex and shaped by context. Ramsden’s [-@ramsden2003] ideas on [[30 Permanent Notes/Learning Approaches\|deep and surface learning]] tie into this, showing how students’ approaches to learning evolve in similar ways. Erickson et al. also follow this pattern, describing a shift from basic _knowing_ to deeper, higher-order _thinking_. In the early stages, students tend to stick with surface learning—focusing on memorization and looking to authority for clear answers—just as we see in Perry’s _Dualism_ and Baxter Magolda’s _Absolute Knowing_. At this level, they’re all about finishing tasks rather than really digging in and understanding, which lines up with what Erickson would call that first phase of simply “knowing.”

As students start to transition, things get a little more complicated. In Perry’s _Multiplicity_ stage and Baxter Magolda’s _Transitional Knowing_, they begin to realize that there’s more than one way to see things, though they might not yet know how to handle that complexity. This stage often still includes some surface learning, but if teaching strategies encourage discussion and reflection, it can help push them toward deeper engagement. Erickson’s framework lines up here as well, moving from basic knowledge into understanding and applying, and Ramsden would agree that this is where students start making more meaningful connections.

Then we get to the more advanced stages—Perry’s _Contextual Relativism_ and Baxter Magolda’s _Contextual Knowing_—where students fully embrace a deep learning approach. At this point, they’re not just taking in information; they’re thinking critically, making connections, and applying what they know in new ways. Ramsden’s concept of deep learning really shines here, as students learn to analyze, synthesize, and create. This also matches up with Erickson et al.’s higher level of _thinking_, where students don’t just understand—they apply and adapt knowledge thoughtfully. Teaching strategies for this stage should involve activities like case studies and complex projects, which encourage students to think independently and apply their knowledge in meaningful ways.

Together, these four models highlight how teaching needs to adapt as students move from surface-level learning to a place where depth, understanding, and real-world application take center stage.
