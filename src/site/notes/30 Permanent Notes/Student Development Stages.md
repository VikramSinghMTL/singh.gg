To incorporate Barr and Taggâ€™s shift from the **Instruction Paradigm** to the **Learning Paradigm**, we can weave their principles into this note, particularly as a framework for understanding why a teaching-centered approach falls short as students progress in their cognitive and epistemological development. Hereâ€™s how this might look:

Both Baxter Magoldaâ€™s [-@baxtermagolda1992] [[20 Literature Notes/baxtermagolda1992\|Responsive Teaching]] and Mooreâ€™s [-@moore1994] take on the [[20 Literature Notes/moore1994\|Perry Schema]] look at how students move from seeing knowledge as fixed to understanding it as something more complex and shaped by context. This shift parallels what Barr and Tagg [-@barr1995] describe as moving from the [[20 Literature Notes/barr1995\|Instruction Paradigm, where the focus is on delivering content, to the Learning Paradigm]], where the goal is to create an environment that supports studentsâ€™ active learning and meaning-making. In this paradigm, teaching isnâ€™t just about covering material; itâ€™s about fostering environments where students take ownership of their learning.

[[20 Literature Notes/ramsden2003\|Ramsdenâ€™s]] [-@ramsden2003] ideas on [[30 Permanent Notes/Learning Approaches\|deep and surface learning]] tie into this, showing how studentsâ€™ approaches to learning evolve in similar ways. Erickson et al. also follow this pattern, describing a shift from basic [[20 Literature Notes/erickson2009\|knowing to deeper, higher-order thinking]]. In the early stages, students tend to stick with surface learningâ€”focusing on memorization and looking to authority for clear answersâ€”just as we see in Perryâ€™s _Dualism_ and Baxter Magoldaâ€™s _Absolute Knowing_. At this level, theyâ€™re all about finishing tasks rather than really digging in and understanding, which aligns with the **Instruction Paradigm**, where knowledge is seen as something to be delivered and absorbed rather than critically engaged with.

As students start to transition, things get a little more complicated. In Perryâ€™s _Multiplicity_ stage and Baxter Magoldaâ€™s _Transitional Knowing_, they begin to realize that thereâ€™s more than one way to see things, though they might not yet know how to handle that complexity. This stage often still includes some surface learning, but if teaching strategies encourage discussion and reflection, it can help push them toward deeper engagement. Ericksonâ€™s framework lines up here as well, moving from basic knowledge into understanding and applying, and Ramsden would agree that this is where students start making more meaningful connections. Barr and Taggâ€™s _Learning Paradigm_ suggests that instructional approaches here should shift to environments that enable students to encounter, discuss, and question ideas rather than passively receive them, supporting their movement toward independent thought.

Then we get to the more advanced stages, Perryâ€™s _Contextual Relativism_ and Baxter Magoldaâ€™s _Contextual Knowing_, where students fully embrace a deep learning approach. At this point, theyâ€™re not just taking in information; theyâ€™re thinking critically, making connections, and applying what they know in new ways. Ramsdenâ€™s concept of deep learning really shines here, as students learn to analyze, synthesize, and create. This also matches up with Erickson et al.â€™s higher level of _thinking_, where students donâ€™t just understandâ€”they apply and adapt knowledge thoughtfully. Teaching strategies for this stage should involve activities like case studies and complex projects, which encourage students to think independently and apply their knowledge in meaningful ways, fully embodying Barr and Taggâ€™s _Learning Paradigm_ by placing students in charge of their own intellectual development.

Together, these four models highlight how teaching needs to adapt as students move from surface-level learning to a place where depth, understanding, and real-world application take center stage.
