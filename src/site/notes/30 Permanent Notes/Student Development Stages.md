Both Baxter Magoldaâ€™s [-@baxtermagolda1992] _Responsive Teaching_ and Mooreâ€™s [-@moore1994] interpretation of the _Perry Schema_ outline how students progress from seeing knowledge as absolute to understanding it as contextual and constructed. Ramsdenâ€™s [-@ramsden2003] distinction between [[30 Permanent Notes/Learning Approaches\|deep and surface learning]] parallels the stages in these models. Early stages align with surface approaches, where students focus on rote memorization and rely heavily on authority, as seen in Perryâ€™s _Dualism_ and Baxter Magoldaâ€™s _Absolute Knowing_. Here, students often exhibit surface learning, aiming for completion rather than true understanding.

Erickson, Peters, and Strommerâ€™s focus on the progression from basic _knowing_ to higher-order _thinking_ also echoes these stages. Their framework underscores the importance of moving students beyond memorization to understanding, applying, and creating, aligning closely with Ramsdenâ€™s emphasis on fostering deep learning.

As students transition to _Multiplicity_ (Perry) or _Transitional Knowing_ (Baxter Magolda), they begin to recognize the existence of multiple perspectives, although they may not yet fully understand how to evaluate or integrate them. This stage still carries elements of surface learning, but teaching strategies that promote discussion and reflection can start to shift students toward deeper engagement.

In the later stages, such as _Contextual Relativism_ (Perry) and _Contextual Knowing_ (Baxter Magolda), students adopt a deep approach to learning. They seek to understand and apply knowledge, engage critically with content, and make connections that extend beyond the classroom. Ramsdenâ€™s concept of deep learning is exemplified here, as students analyze, synthesize, and create, reflecting a mature level of cognitive development. Erickson et al.â€™s progression to the _thinking_ stage underscores this shift, showing that effective teaching must encourage students to move from simple comprehension to complex application and reflection. Teaching strategies at this stage should include complex, reflective activities like case studies and problem-solving projects to foster independent thinking and meaningful application.

Thus, all four models illustrate how instructional methods should evolve to guide students from early, surface-level learning to later stages that prioritize depth, understanding, and application.
