Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping education by influencing learning, assessment, instructional design, and information literacy. AI tools such as ChatGPT introduce new opportunities and challenges in pedagogy, requiring educators to rethink traditional teaching methods and student engagement strategies.

## [[20 Literature Notes/coyle2023\|AI Literacy & Source Evaluation]]

AI-generated text is probabilistic, not factual, meaning it can generate plausible but false information (i.e. hallucinations) [@coyle2023]. Teaching AI literacy involves integrating critical thinking, media literacy, and [[30 Permanent Notes/Digital Competency\|digital competency]] into coursework. Students and educators must develop AI literacy skills, including:

  - **Prompt engineering**: Asking AI the right questions to refine responses.
  - **Verification methods**: Cross-checking AI-generated claims with credible sources.
  - **Ethical considerations**: Bias in AI models, environmental costs, and labor exploitation in AI dataset curation.

## AI & Instructional Design

The role of educators shifts from content deliverers to facilitators of critical engagement with AI-generated content. AI should be used as a co-pilot, not a replacement, ensuring students remain active in their learning process. AI tools can support:

  - Personalized learning pathways based on student input.
  - Automated feedback for drafts, coding assignments, and structured writing.
  - Adaptive assessments that modify difficulty based on student responses.

## AI & Assessment in Education

- Fact-recall and rote memorization tasks are easily handled by AI, necessitating a shift toward:
  - Synthesis-based assignments that require human interpretation.
  - Justification tasks, where students must defend claims with verified evidence.
  - Comparative analysis, contrasting AI-generated responses with human-written content.
- AI can be used in formative assessment but should not replace qualitative feedback from educators and peers.

## AI Ethics & Pedagogical Implications

- AI raises ethical concerns including:
  - Bias in training data, reflecting systemic inequities.
  - Data privacy issues, as AI interactions may collect user data.
  - Labor exploitation, particularly in AI content moderation.
- Educators should facilitate discussions on ethical AI use in academia.

## Future Considerations

- AIâ€™s capabilities are rapidly evolving, requiring continuous professional development for educators.
- Institutional policies on AI use should be defined to maintain academic integrity while embracing AI as a pedagogical tool.
