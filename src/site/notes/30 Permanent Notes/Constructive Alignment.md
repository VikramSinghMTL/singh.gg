_Constructive alignment_ is all about making sure that [[learning objectives\|learning objectives]], [[instructional strategies\|instructional strategies]], and [[assessments\|assessments]] are all pulling in the same direction to create a meaningful learning experience. [[20 Literature Notes/biggs2012\|Biggs]] [-@biggs2012] introduced this idea, emphasizing that students learn best when everything in a course, from whatâ€™s taught to how itâ€™s assessed, is connected and aimed at clear outcomes. [[20 Literature Notes/ramsden2003\|Ramsden]] [-@ramsden2003] adds that designing for a deep learning approach leads to much better outcomes, compared to surface learning that just scratches the surface with rote memorization. The idea of [[20 Literature Notes/whetten2007\|backward design]] [@whetten2007] fits right in here, as it focuses on building courses around the intended results, ensuring that each part of the course supports those goals. [[20 Literature Notes/baxtermagolda1992\|Responsive teaching]] [@baxtermagolda1992] also plays a role by encouraging engagement through personal interactions, discussions, and hands-on activities, creating an environment where students feel involved and motivated to learn.

## Relevance

In my computer science courses, I use _constructive alignment_ by designing projects and assessments that reflect real-world scenariosâ€”like evaluating the efficiency of algorithms. For example, we do hands-on coding labs and group discussions that help students tackle practical problems. This approach makes sure that what students are learning in class isnâ€™t just theory, but something they can apply, pushing them beyond rote memorization and into deeper engagement with the material.

## Challenges

One big challenge with _constructive alignment_ is finding the time to work in meaningful activities without cutting into essential content. Balancing active learning and time constraints can be tricky, especially when thereâ€™s a lot of material to cover. But as Ramsden and Baxter Magolda suggest, encouraging students to dive deep into what theyâ€™re learning is worth the effort, even if it means rethinking how class time is used [@ramsden2003; @baxtermagolda1992].
