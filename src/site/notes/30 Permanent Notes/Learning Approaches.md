Deep and surface learning represent two fundamentally different approaches students take toward learning. A *deep learning* approach involves engaging with content to understand it fully, making meaningful connections, and applying knowledge in various contexts. In contrast, a *surface learning* approach is characterized by rote memorization and fulfilling minimum requirements without seeking to understand the material [@ramsden2003]. When course design fosters interest and relevance, students are more likely to adopt deep learning strategies. However, surface learning often results from excessive workload, assessment pressure, or poorly designed courses that prioritize memorization over understanding.

Constructive alignment [-@biggs2012] supports deep learning by ensuring that learning objectives, activities, and assessments are aligned to promote comprehensive engagement with the content. This alignment encourages students to relate new material to what they already know and apply it in practical, problem-solving contexts. *[[30 Permanent Notes/Constructive Alignment\|Backwards Design]]* [@whetten2007] further complements the move towards deep learning by focusing course planning on the intended learning outcomes and ensuring that assessments and activities are structured to lead students toward those outcomes. The integration of *responsive teaching* [@baxtermagolda1992] helps tailor these learning experiences to match students' developmental stages, further reinforcing deep engagement.

## Relevance

In my computer science courses, promoting deep learning means designing projects and problem-solving tasks that require students to analyze, synthesize, and apply knowledge. For instance, instead of simple syntax practice, students work on coding challenges that require them to break down complex problems (functional decomposition) and evaluate different solutions. This method helps move students from superficial trial-and-error strategies to reflective and strategic learning.

## Challenges

Despite efforts to foster deep learning, students often resort to surface approaches, especially under time constraints or when faced with high-stakes assessments. Addressing this requires balancing the depth and breadth of course content and providing adequate support and feedback to guide students toward deeper understanding.
