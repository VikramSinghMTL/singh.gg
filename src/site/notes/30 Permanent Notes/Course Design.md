This course explored key principles of learner-centered teaching, curriculum planning, and reflection on teaching practices in the context of the Cegep system. We learned about the competency-based approach, curriculum alignment, and the importance of understanding both our [[50 Works/My Philosophy of Education\|teaching philosophies]] and students' perspectives.

## Big Ideas

1. **Competency-Based Education (CBE) and the Cegep System**:
   - Understanding the history, goals, and structure of Cegeps.
   - Examining competency-based education as it applies to both career and pre-university programs.
   - Reflection on how CBE aligns with current practices in higher education.

2. **Curriculum Design**:
   - The process of course design, including developing learning outcomes, aligning competencies with instructional strategies, and assessments.
   - Application of taxonomies like Bloomâ€™s and Finkâ€™s to ensure clear learning objectives and intellectual abilities.

3. **Teaching Philosophy and Reflection**:
   - Continuous reflection on oneâ€™s assumptions and beliefs about teaching.
   - Differentiating between knowing a subject and effectively teaching it, with a focus on the unique pedagogical approaches required for different disciplines.

4. **Understanding Students**:
   - Recognizing the different epistemological beliefs students bring to the classroom (based on Perry's schema and Baxter-Magoldaâ€™s frameworks).
   - Adjusting teaching strategies to meet students where they are in their intellectual development.

## Computer Science Teaching

- **Competency-Based Education**: In my computer science courses, the competency-based approach aligns well with project-based learning, especially in coding courses where students must demonstrate practical, applied skills.
- **Curriculum Alignment**: I found the principles of curriculum alignment useful in ensuring that my course assessments are closely tied to learning outcomes. For example, when teaching data structures, my exams and projects directly measure both theoretical understanding and the practical implementation of algorithms.
- **Student Reflection**: The insights about students' assumptions about learning prompted me to integrate more metacognitive activities into my classes. I ask students to reflect on how they approach problem-solving in coding, which aligns with Baxter-Magoldaâ€™s ideas about students' intellectual development.
