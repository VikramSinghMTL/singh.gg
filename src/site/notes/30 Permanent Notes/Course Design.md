The shift from a teaching-centered approach to a learning-centered approach is essential in fostering an educational environment where students are active participants. This transition has been articulated by education theorists like Barr and Tagg, as well as Biggs, whose model of _constructive alignment_ has become a cornerstone in modern pedagogy. Instead of focusing on lecture delivery, emphasis should be on designing learning experiences that engage students as active [[30 Permanent Notes/Constructivism\|constructors]] of their knowledge.

**Baxter Magolda‚Äôs** work extends this idea by emphasizing the importance of _responsive teaching_‚Äîadapting teaching methods to align with students‚Äô diverse ways of knowing, from absolute to contextual. This approach ensures that students are not only participating but are engaged in ways that match their developmental stage, fostering a deeper sense of understanding and independent thought.

The shift from a teaching-centered to a learning-centered approach has been explored by various theorists. The Perry Schema, as outlined by William S. Moore, adds a nuanced layer to this shift by explaining how students evolve from seeing knowledge as absolute (dualism) to viewing it as complex and contextual (contextual relativism). This cognitive progression is crucial for educators to consider when designing responsive, student-centered learning experiences that not only impart knowledge but also facilitate the development of critical thinking and personal meaning-making.

The shift from teaching-centered to learning-centered approaches aligns with fostering deeper intellectual development, as described by Erickson, Peters, and Strommer. Effective teaching progresses from helping students memorize content (knowing), to recognizing relationships (understanding), to applying knowledge in complex ways (thinking). This echoes the importance of creating student-centered learning experiences that not only impart content but help students practice and reflect, developing their ability to think critically and learn independently.

Whetten‚Äôs principles align with the shift from teaching-centered to learning-centered education by emphasizing course design as the driver of student learning. He supports this through the concept of _backward design_, where learning outcomes inform the development of activities and assessments. This complements Biggs‚Äô _constructive alignment_, Baxter Magolda‚Äôs _responsive teaching_, and Moore‚Äôs _Perry Schema_ by reinforcing that the planning of what students do is essential for fostering deep learning.

Ramsden‚Äôs discussion on deep and surface approaches to learning underscores the importance of designing courses that prioritize meaningful engagement. This insight complements Biggs‚Äô _constructive alignment_ and Whetten‚Äôs _backward design_, reinforcing that fostering deep learning is key to effective education. It also aligns with Baxter Magolda‚Äôs _responsive teaching_, which supports students‚Äô development through engaging tasks.

## Relevance

In my experience as a student, especially at the university level, the emphasis was definitely on the teacher. When I ended up flunking out, which of course was due to my lack of effort, a part of it was how impersonal the whole experience was versus my experience in cegep. It very much was the [[banking model of education\|banking model of education]]. This rigid, one-size-fits-all approach did not consider the variability in how students learn or develop.

As a teacher, I can feel the shift in the room when the focus is on me versus the students. I bore myself when I lecture too much. The students fall asleep. I‚Äôve done this too many times where I throw out a ‚Äúis everyone good with that?‚Äù and they nod, and I move on. Who knows if they learned what I was talking about in that moment? Baxter Magolda‚Äôs insights remind me that engaging students through responsive teaching‚Äîapproachable interactions, discussions, and activities‚Äîenables them to move beyond passive listening to active engagement.

Designing learning experiences could include methods like collaborative coding projects or peer reviews in computer science, where students actively engage in problem-solving and receive feedback that reinforces their understanding. This not only mirrors Biggs‚Äô idea of constructive alignment but also embodies Baxter Magolda‚Äôs emphasis on teaching responsively to support students‚Äô evolving ways of knowing.

In later computer science courses, _contextual relativism_ emerges when students learn there is no single ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù solution to problems. For example, in an _Algorithms and Data Structures_ course, choosing between sorting algorithms like _Merge Sort_ or _Quick Sort_ depends on context. Students must weigh factors such as data size, space complexity, and stability. This teaches them that decisions in software development often involve trade-offs, moving beyond black-and-white thinking to understanding that the best solution varies with the situation.

In computer science, foundational courses focus on memorization‚Äîlearning syntax and basic concepts. As students advance, they apply skills like **functional decomposition** to break down complex problems. The ‚Äúthinking‚Äù phase goes further, involving tasks that require analysis and adaptation, such as designing new algorithms or optimizing existing code. For example, students might be tasked with creating custom data structures or solving open-ended problems with multiple solutions. This approach pushes them to think critically and adapt knowledge to real-world constraints, aligning with Erickson, Peters, and Strommer‚Äôs focus on deep learning.

The shift from a teaching-centered to a learning-centered approach benefits from structured frameworks like Krathwohl‚Äôs revised Bloom‚Äôs Taxonomy. This taxonomy‚Äôs dual dimensions of _Knowledge_ (e.g., Factual, Conceptual, Metacognitive) and _Cognitive Processes_ (e.g., Apply, Analyze, Create) support designing comprehensive learning experiences that align teaching objectives with assessments and activities. This approach complements Biggs‚Äô _constructive alignment_ and further underscores the importance of targeting higher-order thinking skills, such as analysis and creation.

- **Remember**: Recall the syntax for writing a for loop in JavaScript.
- **Understand**: Explain how recursion works using a simple example, such as the Fibonacci sequence.
- **Apply**: Write a function that sorts an array using the _Quick Sort_ algorithm.
- **Analyze**: Compare the time complexity of different sorting algorithms and identify which is most efficient for various input sizes.
- **Evaluate**: Critique a peer‚Äôs code for readability and performance, suggesting improvements.
- **Create**: Develop a small web application that uses modular components and implements client-server communication.
- **Metacognition**: Participate in a _scrum stand-up_ where you discuss what you‚Äôre working on, reflect on your progress, and identify any blockers hindering your work.

Starting with the objective _‚ÄúCompare the time complexity of different sorting algorithms and identify which is most efficient for various input sizes,‚Äù_ the assessment would involve a project where students analyze and present the performance of different sorting algorithms on datasets of varying sizes. Instructional strategies would include interactive lectures on algorithm analysis, group discussions, and hands-on coding labs where students implement and test algorithms to observe their efficiencies. This approach ensures alignment between the objective, instructional activities, and assessment.

I often observe students resorting to _surface learning_ behaviors, such as panic-copying code and using trial-and-error methods just to make a program work. This approach reflects Ramsden‚Äôs idea of _imitation learning_, where understanding is superficial, and true comprehension is lacking. To encourage a _deep approach_, students should be guided to take a step back, analyze the problem by considering the inputs, outputs, and data types, and then construct a solution methodically. This reflective process not only promotes better problem-solving but also fosters long-term retention and the ability to apply knowledge to new challenges.

## Counterpoints

‚ÄúBut it takes too much in class time!‚Äù a lot of teachers will refute. To them, I say remember the ‚Äúwhat they need to know and what is nice for them to know,‚Äù and if you focus on the need to know, I think you can really fit in everything you need to without fearing losing lecture time. Because when you lecture, you have absolutely no idea if they‚Äôre even learning anything. As Baxter Magolda suggests, evaluating students in a way that encourages thinking and application, rather than rote memorization, is vital to creating a meaningful, responsive educational experience.
