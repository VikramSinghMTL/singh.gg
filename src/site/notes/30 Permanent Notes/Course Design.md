Effective course design goes beyond content delivery; it involves creating a structured, intentional learning journey for students. Central to this process is aligning teaching strategies, assessments, and learning objectives to foster meaningful and active engagement.

- **Learning Approaches**: Understanding how students engage with material is essential, whether through surface learning or deep, critical engagement. [[30 Permanent Notes/Learning Approaches\|Read more about deep and surface learning here]].
- **Student Development Stages**: As students grow, so does their way of understanding and interacting with knowledge. Tailoring teaching to meet these stages supports them in moving from absolute to contextual understanding. [[30 Permanent Notes/Student Development Stages\|Explore the stages of student development here]].
- **Bloom‚Äôs Taxonomy**: Bloom‚Äôs revised taxonomy offers a structured way to create clear, actionable learning objectives that progress from basic recall to higher-order thinking skills. [[30 Permanent Notes/Bloom's Taxonomy\|Learn how Bloom‚Äôs Taxonomy can shape your objectives]].
- **Constructive Alignment**: Aligning objectives, teaching strategies, and assessments ensures that students‚Äô learning experiences are cohesive and goal-focused. [[30 Permanent Notes/Constructive Alignment\|Dive into how constructive alignment supports effective teaching]].

Together, these frameworks provide a roadmap for building courses that engage students in learning that‚Äôs both challenging and relevant. Each model adds a layer to course design, helping educators create environments where students don‚Äôt just acquire information but actively build understanding.

## Relevance

In my experience as a student, especially at the university level, the emphasis was definitely on the teacher. When I ended up flunking out, which of course was due to my lack of effort, a part of it was how impersonal the whole experience was versus my experience in cegep. It very much was the [[banking model of education\|banking model of education]]. This rigid, one-size-fits-all approach did not consider the variability in how students learn or develop.

As a teacher, I can feel the shift in the room when the focus is on me versus the students. I bore myself when I lecture too much. The students fall asleep. I‚Äôve done this too many times where I throw out a ‚Äúis everyone good with that?‚Äù and they nod, and I move on. Who knows if they learned what I was talking about in that moment? Baxter Magolda‚Äôs insights remind me that engaging students through responsive teaching‚Äîapproachable interactions, discussions, and activities‚Äîenables them to move beyond passive listening to active engagement.

Designing learning experiences could include methods like collaborative coding projects or peer reviews in computer science, where students actively engage in problem-solving and receive feedback that reinforces their understanding. This not only mirrors Biggs‚Äô idea of constructive alignment but also embodies Baxter Magolda‚Äôs emphasis on teaching responsively to support students‚Äô evolving ways of knowing.

In later computer science courses, _contextual relativism_ emerges when students learn there is no single ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù solution to problems. For example, in an _Algorithms and Data Structures_ course, choosing between sorting algorithms like _Merge Sort_ or _Quick Sort_ depends on context. Students must weigh factors such as data size, space complexity, and stability. This teaches them that decisions in software development often involve trade-offs, moving beyond black-and-white thinking to understanding that the best solution varies with the situation.

In computer science, foundational courses focus on memorization‚Äîlearning syntax and basic concepts. As students advance, they apply skills like **functional decomposition** to break down complex problems. The ‚Äúthinking‚Äù phase goes further, involving tasks that require analysis and adaptation, such as designing new algorithms or optimizing existing code. For example, students might be tasked with creating custom data structures or solving open-ended problems with multiple solutions. This approach pushes them to think critically and adapt knowledge to real-world constraints, aligning with Erickson, Peters, and Strommer‚Äôs focus on deep learning.

The shift from a teaching-centered to a learning-centered approach benefits from structured frameworks like Krathwohl‚Äôs revised Bloom‚Äôs Taxonomy. This taxonomy‚Äôs dual dimensions of _Knowledge_ (e.g., Factual, Conceptual, Metacognitive) and _Cognitive Processes_ (e.g., Apply, Analyze, Create) support designing comprehensive learning experiences that align teaching objectives with assessments and activities. This approach complements Biggs‚Äô _constructive alignment_ and further underscores the importance of targeting higher-order thinking skills, such as analysis and creation.

- **Remember**: Recall the syntax for writing a for loop in JavaScript.
- **Understand**: Explain how recursion works using a simple example, such as the Fibonacci sequence.
- **Apply**: Write a function that sorts an array using the _Quick Sort_ algorithm.
- **Analyze**: Compare the time complexity of different sorting algorithms and identify which is most efficient for various input sizes.
- **Evaluate**: Critique a peer‚Äôs code for readability and performance, suggesting improvements.
- **Create**: Develop a small web application that uses modular components and implements client-server communication.
- **Metacognition**: Participate in a _scrum stand-up_ where you discuss what you‚Äôre working on, reflect on your progress, and identify any blockers hindering your work.

Starting with the objective _‚ÄúCompare the time complexity of different sorting algorithms and identify which is most efficient for various input sizes,‚Äù_ the assessment would involve a project where students analyze and present the performance of different sorting algorithms on datasets of varying sizes. Instructional strategies would include interactive lectures on algorithm analysis, group discussions, and hands-on coding labs where students implement and test algorithms to observe their efficiencies. This approach ensures alignment between the objective, instructional activities, and assessment.

I often observe students resorting to _surface learning_ behaviors, such as panic-copying code and using trial-and-error methods just to make a program work. This approach reflects Ramsden‚Äôs idea of _imitation learning_, where understanding is superficial, and true comprehension is lacking. To encourage a _deep approach_, students should be guided to take a step back, analyze the problem by considering the inputs, outputs, and data types, and then construct a solution methodically. This reflective process not only promotes better problem-solving but also fosters long-term retention and the ability to apply knowledge to new challenges.

## Counterpoints

‚ÄúBut it takes too much in class time!‚Äù a lot of teachers will refute. To them, I say remember the ‚Äúwhat they need to know and what is nice for them to know,‚Äù and if you focus on the need to know, I think you can really fit in everything you need to without fearing losing lecture time. Because when you lecture, you have absolutely no idea if they‚Äôre even learning anything. As Baxter Magolda suggests, evaluating students in a way that encourages thinking and application, rather than rote memorization, is vital to creating a meaningful, responsive educational experience.
