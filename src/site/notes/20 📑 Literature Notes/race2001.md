> The purposes of this briefing are to alert you to the roles which can be played by student selfassessment, peer-assessment and group assessment to enhance studentsâ€™ learning, and to diversify the range of assessment approaches and formats used in higher education. The briefing explores how to introduce and implement these different forms of assessment, and discusses the extent to which they can be made valid, reliable and transparent to students (and to those reviewing the quality of assessment in higher education). A further aim of this briefing is to increase your own belief in the value of adopting one or more of these assessment tactics into your own assessment strategy.
