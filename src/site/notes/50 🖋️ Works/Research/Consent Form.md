## Purpose

This project is being conducted by Vikram Singh, a Computer Science Teacher at John Abbott College, for the completion of a Master’s Degree in College Teaching, accredited by the Université de Sherbrooke. This study explores how different approaches to peer code review affect student motivation and feedback quality.

## Procedure

Depending on your section, you will be in one of two groups:

- **Group A:** You'll play a short game related to code review concepts, followed by a peer code review activity.
- **Group B:** You'll participate in a standard peer code review activity.

Regardless of your group, you'll complete a survey about your experience and your feedback will be analyzed along with the contents of the feedback you gave your peer.

## Potential Risks

There are no known risks for participation in this study.

## Potential Benefits

By investigating what makes peer code review motivating (or not), your participation could lead to the design of interventions that make peer code review a more engaging and beneficial process for everyone. Your participation could help students develop stronger feedback skills, crucial for both their success in CS courses and future careers. The findings could provide valuable information to your instructor and others about how to refine peer code review practices, potentially leading to widespread changes that enhance the learning experience for many CS students. For your interest, the results of the study will be sent to you after the study has been completed, if so desired.

## Confidentiality

Your participation in this study is confidential in the following ways:

1. Your name will not appear in the research results.
2. The researcher/teacher will never know if you agree or do not agree to participate in this study, therefore the choice to participate or not has no impact on your final grade, nor on any future interaction with your teacher. The supervisor will randomly select students from those who do accept and the names will be removed from the student work which is used for data collection.
3. The feedback comments and survey results will be anonymous and kept for five years in Microsoft OneDrive behind two-factor authentication.
4. The Microsoft Forms questionnaire will be completed anonymously and your personal information will not be revealed. The servers for Microsoft Forms and OneDrive are stored in Canada and therefore your data is protected by Canadian laws.

## Right to Withdraw

Your participation in this research is completely voluntary. You have the right to not participate or withdraw without the teacher’s knowledge at any time by contacting the research supervisor, Paul Darvasi, at [paul.darvasi@usherbrooke.ca](mailto:paul.darvasi@usherbrooke.ca).
