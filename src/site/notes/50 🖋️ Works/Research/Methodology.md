This project is grounded in the existing literature on PCR, the application of motivational theories (specifically SDT) to education, and the use of GBL in CS. It will contribute to the field by exploring a novel approach to a persistent challenge in CS educationâ€“how to cultivate the student motivation essential for effective PCR and the development of crucial software development skills.

## 4.1 Research Questions

1. Does a game-based learning intervention increase the quality of feedback provided during CS PCR?
2. Does the game-based learning intervention influence students' perceived competence, autonomy, and relatedness, as conceptualized by SDT?

## 4.2 Research Design

This study will employ a quantitative quasi-experimental design. A two-group post-test design will allow for the investigation of how a GBL intervention influences both the quality of feedback provided during CS PCR and students' self-reported motivation in alignment with SDT.

## 4.3 Target population

The target population is third-year CS students at the CEGEP level in Quebec. This population is selected due to their advanced programming experience and the critical role of PCR in preparing them for collaborative software development practices. The study will be conducted within two sections of an advanced programming course in the CS program at John Abbott College, with a sample population of approximately 30-45 students.

## 4.4 Procedure

At the beginning of the Fall 2024 semester, the students will be informed that their teacher is conducting a research project about PCR. They will be notified that around week 10, all students (approximately 30-45) will engage in a PCR exercise during their regular class time. Participants will be in one of two groups. Group A students will engage in PCR after playing a game specifically designed to employ code review concepts and methods. Alternatively, the game will be unrelated to code review, but prime the cognitive abilities to provide quality feedback. For this reason, The rules and logistics of the game for group A are yet to be determined. Group B students will use the traditional PCR method currently employed in the course. Both groups will use the PCR rubric (Appendix A). Immediately following the PCR exercise, both groups will complete the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) [@ryan1983] (Appendix D).

## 4.5 Instruments

The IMI is a validated Likert-style survey which measures student motivation in the context of PCR, including sub-scales for competence, autonomy, relatedness, and enjoyment. It uses a 7-point scale where 1 is "not at all true" and 7 is "very true". The questions will be rephrased slightly contextualizing the PCR experience. Examples are:

1. I think peer code review is an important activity.
2. I think I am pretty good at peer code review.

A Code Review Taxonomy [@hamer2015; @indriasari2023] (Appendix B) will designate comments within categories such as "positive", "negative", "advice/action", as well as the specificity of these comments (general or code-specific).

## 4.6 Data Analysis

T-tests or ANOVA will be used to compare mean scores on IMI sub-scales between the game-based and non-game-based groups. This will assess differences in motivational outcomes as a result of the type of PCR approach. Frequency counts will be generated for each type of feedback provided by both groups using the code review taxonomy. Chi-square tests will be used to compare the prevalence of different feedback types between the two groups.

## 4.7 Ethical Considerations

The researcher's dual role as an instructor and researcher presents potential for coercion, thus the researcher will not be present during the data collection phase if this is seen as problematic. If so, The facilitator will be a colleague from the JAC Computer Science program or the research supervisor. Explicitly informed consent (Appendix C) and measures to protect student confidentiality and grades are crucial, so all student data will be anonymized by the intervention facilitator to reduce the researcher's bias. Student will be informed that they can opt-out at any point even after the data is collected. All students will be given the GBL experience after the data collection phase to ensure equity of treatment. The data will be collected through either a Moodle or Microsoft form. In either case, the anonymized data will be held on Canadian servers.

## 4.8 Timeline

Data will be collected around week 7-8 of the Fall 2024 semester in my Game Programming course. The collection process will last between 1.5-3 hours during a period of one class. After the data is collected, the data will be analyzed in the latter half of the Fall 2024 semester into the Winter 2025 semester. The final paper will be finalized in Winter 2025 and submitted in Spring 2025. The results will be shared during MEC953.
