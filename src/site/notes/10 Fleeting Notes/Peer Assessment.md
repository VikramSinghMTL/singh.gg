## Peer Assessment

### Initial Thoughts

- Everyone gets a link to a random assignment repo (anonymous).
    - Make everyone's repo public? So non anonymous? I mean, when they get a job, all their code will be not anonymous so it would be authentic.
- They are given a checklist and have to play test the game to see if it meets all of the requirements.
- What is something they did well?
- What is <mark class="hltr-orange">something that can</mark> be improved upon?

### Implementation

- Using the Moodle workshop activity

### Objectives

What do I want them to get out of PA?

- Ability to analyze, evaluate, and form coherent feedback based on the code
- Identify things the person did well
- Receive feedback without ego
- Implement the feedback that was given to you
- Identify things that you can improve on after having seen you peers' work
